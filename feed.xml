        <title>#! /usr/bin/env considered harmful</title>
        
        <description>
          Many programming guides recommend to begin scripts with the #! /usr/bin/env shebang in order to to automatically locate the necessary interpreter. For example, for a Python script you would use #! /usr/bin/env python, and then the saying goes, the script would “just work” on any machine with Python installed.

        <title>Visual Studio Code: A modern editor</title>
        
        <description>
          On April 14th, 2016, Microsoft announced the 1.0 release of their open-source Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor. I’ve been drive-testing it for a few months and have been quite pleased with it, so here go my impressions.

        <title>A look at Go from a newbie&#39;s perspective</title>
        
        <description>
          I confess I am late to the game: the Go programming language came out in 2009 and I had not had the chance to go all in for a real project until two weeks ago. Here is a summary of my experience. Spoiler alert: I’m truly pleased.

        <title>Those pesky Makefiles</title>
        
        <description>
          As a software developer, you have probably disregarded the build system of your project—those pesky Makefiles—as unimportant. You have probably “chosen” to use the de-facto build tool make(1). And you have probably hacked your way around until things “seemingly worked”.

But hang on a second. Those build files are way more important than you may think and deserve a wee bit more attention.

        <title>Analysis of SSHFS performance for large builds</title>
        
        <description>
          Last week, I spent some time looking at the feasibility of using SSHFS on OS X to access Google’s centralized source tree for the purpose of issuing local builds. My goals were two-fold: first, to avoid having to “clone” the large source code of the apps I wanted to build; and, second, to avoid having to port the source file system (a FUSE module) to the Mac.

What I found highlights that SSHFS is not the right choice for locally building a remote source tree. That said, the overall study process was interesting, fun, and I am now tempted to make SSHFS viable for this use case. Read on for the details.

        <title>The Medium experiment wrap-up</title>
        
        <description>
          Eight months ago, I decided to try
Medium as the platform on which to
post my essays.  Over this time I have published a handful of posts in
there—8, to be precise, which is… a very shy number—but the
results have been quite satisfactory: the WYSIWYG composer is excellent,
the analytics tools are simple but to the point, the looks are great, and
the community is nice (though I haven’t been able to tap into it just yet).
But where have things failed?

        <title>Joining the Blaze team</title>
        
        <description>
          It has been over 6 years since I joined
Google and
throughout this time I have been in the Storage SRE family: first with GFS,
then with Colossus, and last with Persistent Disk.  Even though this counts as
3 different teams, the reality is that I have been doing mostly the same type
of work all around.

I had pondered the idea of switching to a pure Software Engineer (SWE) role for
all these years and never taken any action.  Until now.  Things change, and the
time has come for me to make a move and pursue that thought in an effort to
grow in a different direction.  And why now, you ask?  Well, simply because I
have found a role in the NYC office for a project that I am personally
passionate about.

        <title>Introducing Nudgy Timer</title>
        
        <description>
          

For the last two years, I had been meaning to write an Android app just for
the sake of it.  I had attempted to do so in short chunks of “free time”,
but that never played out well: I had to force myself to sit down for a few
hours straight to fight Android Studio and overcome the initial
difficulties in coding for an unknown platform.  That’s why, during the
last Thanksgiving week, I took three days off of work to focus on writing
my first Android app.  The goal was to get a basic app that could later be
built on iteratively as open source.  The specifics of the app did not
matter much for this exercise, but I had a simple idea in mind.
