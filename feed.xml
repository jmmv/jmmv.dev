I could have written a trivial shell script to do it, but instead I reached out for shtk&amp;rsquo;s unit-testing module. I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmmv/status/1710309896670081083">tweeted about it&lt;/a> right away to just say that you can, in fact, write tests in shell because lots of developers are skeptical about any script longer than 10 lines of code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, this reply came through: a pointer to a contemporary, under-development library for writing tests in Bash. Which made me think: &amp;ldquo;Hey, I had already done that years ago&amp;hellip; but nobody knows about it. Gotta fix that with a blog post!&amp;rdquo; But first, I had to bring shtk back from its ashes because I had not touched it for more than 6 years and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t read for show and tell. So I did something that I wanted to do back in the day but never did: I put together &lt;a href="https://shtk.jmmv.dev/">a website for shtk&lt;/a> to host its &lt;a href="https://shtk.jmmv.dev/docs.html">reference manual&lt;/a> and I fixed a few obvious rough edges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With those tweaks out of the way, we come to this article. In here, I want to show you how writing decent tests in shell is entirely possible and how shtk&amp;rsquo;s testing platform provides unique features to do integration testing of CLI apps written in any language.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-11-shell-hammer-wrench.jpg" length="398237" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Analyzing OOMs in IntelliJ with Bazel</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/analyzing-ooms-in-intellij-with-bazel.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Oct 2023 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/analyzing-ooms-in-intellij-with-bazel.html</guid><description>A few months ago, we described how we fixed three different OOM scenarios in our ongoing migration to the Bazel build system here at Snowflake.

The reason this issue surfaced now is because, as we continue our migration to Bazel, our IjwB project has grown in size.</description></item><item><title>5 ways to instantiate Rust structs in tests</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/rust-test-structs.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Oct 2023 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/rust-test-structs.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of static typing and I&amp;rsquo;ve found that using narrow types for each entity in the object model of my programs reduces errors. Rust is particularly well-suited at this task: its lack of implicit type conversions eliminates surprises, and its ownership semantics allow type transformations with zero cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, (ab)using narrow types in an app&amp;rsquo;s domain is &lt;em>really&lt;/em> annoying when writing tests. While non-test code rarely instantiates new objects&amp;mdash;in the case of a REST service, this would only happen at the service&amp;rsquo;s boundaries&amp;mdash;tests instantiate objects infinitely more times than non-test code. Code patterns that may seem reasonable in non-test code can become unbearable in tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I want to look into the various ways in which you can instantiate strongly-typed objects. For each, I show examples and describe their pros and cons. And yes, as a matter of fact, I have tried them all before&amp;hellip; and I can&amp;rsquo;t yet make my mind as to which one is best.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-06-rust-test-structs.png" length="138979" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Good performance is not just big O</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/09/performance-is-not-big-o.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2023 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/09/performance-is-not-big-o.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Having a fast and responsive app is orthogonal to &amp;ldquo;knowing your big &lt;i>O&lt;/i>s&amp;rdquo;. Unfortunately, most tech companies over-emphasize algorithms in interviews and downplay systems knowledge, and I believe that&amp;rsquo;s one reason behind sluggish apps and bloated systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this play out repeatedly. Interviewers ask a LeetCode-style coding question, which is then followed by the ritual of discussing time and memory complexity. Candidates ace the answers. But then&amp;hellip; their &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; code suffers from subtle yet impactful performance problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Focusing on big &lt;em>O&lt;/em> complexity rarely matters in most apps. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s important to think about your algorithmic choices, but there are so many more details to worry about that have a direct impact on app performance and responsiveness. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a bunch of them!&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-09-08-speed-bumps-limit.jpg" length="372231" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Costs exposed: Frameworks</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/costs-exposed-frameworks.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2023 07:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/costs-exposed-frameworks.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2023/06/fast-machines-slow-machines.html">&amp;ldquo;Fast machines, slow machines&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; ah, the post that spawned these series. As I frantically typed that article while replying to angry tweets, the thought came to mind: software engineering as a whole is hyper-focused on lowering the costs to write new code, yet there is a disregard for the costs that these improvements bring to other disciplines in a company on even to end users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in this series finale, I want to compare how some choices that apparently lower development costs actually increase costs elsewhere. I also want to highlight how, if we made different decisions during development, we could possibly expose those extra costs early on. This is beneficial because exposing costs upfront allows us to make tough choices when there is still a chance of changing course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make things specific, I will look at how the use of modern frameworks that facilitate development can end up hurting performance, reliability, and usability. So let&amp;rsquo;s start with a three-part rant first (sorry) and then let&amp;rsquo;s look at what we might do.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-08-31-dirt-pile.jpg" length="773447" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Costs exposed: On-call ticket handling</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/costs-exposed-on-call-ticket-handling.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Aug 2023 07:20:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/costs-exposed-on-call-ticket-handling.html</guid><description>&lt;p>In the previous post, I proposed that certain engineering practices expose systemic costs and help with planning while other practices hide those same costs and disturb ongoing plans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea I&amp;rsquo;m trying to convey is hard to communicate in the abstract so, in that post, I used the differences between a monorepo and a multirepo setup as an example. Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll expore a different scenario to support the same idea. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about how certain ticket assignment practices during on-call operations can expose service support costs vs. how other practices hide them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that, just like in the previous post, I do not want to compare the general merits of one approach vs. the other. The &lt;em>only&lt;/em> thing I want to compare is whether one approach centralizes toil and allows management to quantify its cost vs. how another approach hides toil by smearing it over the whole team in hard-to-quantify ways. Whether management &lt;em>actually does something&lt;/em> to correct the situation once the costs are exposed is a different story.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-08-26-tickets-phone.jpg" length="539252" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Costs exposed: Monorepo vs. multirepo</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/costs-exposed-monorepo-multirepo.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 06:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/costs-exposed-monorepo-multirepo.html</guid><description>&lt;p>In software engineering organizations, there are certain practices that keep costs under control even if those &lt;em>seem&lt;/em> more expensive at first. Unfortunately, because such practices &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> more expensive, teams choose to keep their status quo even when they know it is suboptimal. This choice ends up hurting productivity and morale because planned work is continuously interrupted, which in turn drags project completion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason I say &lt;em>seem&lt;/em> and not &lt;em>are&lt;/em> is because the alternatives to these cost-exposing practices also suffer from costs. The difference is that, while the former surface costs, leading to the need to allocate time and people to infrastructure work, the latter keeps the costs smeared over teams and individuals in ways that are difficult to account and plan for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To illustrate what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say, I&amp;rsquo;ll present three different scenarios in which this opinion applies. All of these case studies come from past personal experiences while working in different teams and projects. The first one covered in this post is about the adoption of a monorepo vs. the use of multiple different repositories. The other two will come in follow-up articles.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-08-23-freebsd-gnome-repos.png" length="162711" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi 3, rfkill, and real root causing</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/rpi3-rfkill-root-causing.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 06:20:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/rpi3-rfkill-root-causing.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a Raspberry Pi 3 in the garage running Raspbian so it was attached to Ethernet for a long time. A few weeks ago, however, I wanted to bring the Pi into the house so that my kid, who was showing interest in robotics, and I could play with it. That required having the ability to place the device onto the dining table, next to a laptop, which meant connecting it to WiFi. Easy peasy, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well&amp;hellip; while that should have been trivial, it did not work right away and the solutions I found online back then were all nonsensical. I gave up in desperation because I did not have enough time to find the root cause, and all interest was lost. Until last weekend when I gave this ordeal another try. At this point, I found once again the same nonsensical solutions online, got equally frustrated about the fact that they even existed, and decided to find the real answer to my problem on my own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, this is mostly a rant about the Internet being littered with misleading answers of the kind &amp;ldquo;I reinstalled glibc and my problem is gone!&amp;rdquo;. But this is also the tale of a troubleshooting session&amp;mdash;and you know I like to blog about those.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-08-16-rpi3-go2-gpio.jpg" length="346217" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>A failed experiment with Rust static dispatch</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/rust-static-dispatch-failed-experiment.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 05:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/rust-static-dispatch-failed-experiment.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Initial versions of the EndBASIC Service, and therefore initial versions of EndTRACKER, used dynamic dispatch to support abstract definitions of system services such as the database they talk to and the clock they use. This looked like a bunch of &lt;tt>Arc&lt;dyn Foo>&lt;/tt> objects passed around and was done to support extremely fast unit testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I generalized the core logic of these services into the III-IV framework, I decided to experiment with a switch to static dispatch. The rationale was that using static dispatch better aligns with the design of well-regarded crates in the Rust ecosystem, and also because I wanted to avoid unnecessary runtime costs in the foundational pieces of my web services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me tell you that this decision was a huge mistake and that the experiment has utterly failed. Using static dispatch has been a constant source of frustration due to the difficulty in passing types around and reasoning about trait bounds. The situation had gotten so bad that I dreaded adding new functionality to my services whenever a change to a statically-typed &lt;tt>struct&lt;/tt> was needed, because that meant adding yet another type parameter and plumbing it through tens of source files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In lieu of the difficulties, which eventually turned into blockers to implementing new features, I made the choice of going back to dynamic dispatch. The goal was to gain ergonomics at the expense of a supposedly-negligible runtime cost. Let me tell you about the problems I faced, the refactoring journey, and some measurements I gathered after the rewrite.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unit-testing a web service in Rust</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/07/unit-testing-a-web-service.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 06:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/07/unit-testing-a-web-service.html</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the things I'm most proud of the Rust web services I have written is how I can run their tests with zero setup and within milliseconds, all while making me confident that "main" can always be shipped to production.

&lt;p>To make things specific, I'll be describing the testing infrastructure of EndTRACKER, the EndBASIC Service, and the sample key/value store app of III-IV. These services are all structured in three separate layers, and I'll be covering the testing strategy for each of them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ldd(1) and untrusted binaries</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/07/ldd-untrusted-binaries.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 16:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/07/ldd-untrusted-binaries.html</guid><description>While diagnosing a non-determinism Bazel issue at work, I had to compare the dynamic libraries used by two builds of the same binary.

I recorded a couple of crappy videos in 5 minutes, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmmv/status/1671670996921896960">posted them on a Twitter thread&lt;/a>, and went viral with 8.8K likes at this point. I really could not have predicted that, given that I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting what-I-believe-is interesting content for years and&amp;hellip; nothing, almost-zero interest. Now that things have cooled down, it&amp;rsquo;s time to stir the pot and elaborate on those thoughts a bit more rationally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To summarize, the Twitter thread shows two videos: one of an old computer running Windows NT 3.51 and one of a new computer running Windows 11. In each video, I opened and closed a command prompt, File Explorer, Notepad, and Paint. You can clearly see how apps on the old computer open up instantly whereas apps on the new computer show significant lag as they load. I questioned how computers are actually getting better when trivial things like this have regressed. And boom, the likes and reshares started coming in. Obviously some people had issues with my claims, but there seems to be an overwhelming majority of people that agree we have a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To open up, I&amp;rsquo;ll stand my ground: latency in modern computer interfaces, with modern OSes and modern applications, is terrible and getting worse. This applies to smartphones as well. At the same time, while UIs were much more responsible on computers of the past, those computers were also awful in many ways: new systems have changed our lives substantially. So, what gives?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A persistent task queue in Rust</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/06/iii-iv-task-queue.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2023 06:35:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/06/iii-iv-task-queue.html</guid><description>A couple of posts ago, I described why I built custom email subscriptions for this blog.
