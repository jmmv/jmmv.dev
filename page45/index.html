        Once again, CVS shows its weaknesses.  Last night I committed a fix to pkgsrc and soon after I noticed I had a prior e-mail by Alistair, a member of PMC and the one responsible for the preparation of pkgsrc releases, asking developers to stop committing to the tree because he was going to tag it for pkgsrc-2007Q4.  It turns out that my fix did not get into the branch because the directory it went in (devel/monotone) had already been tagged.  Had I committed the fix to, say, x11/zenity, it would have gone into the branch.  Or worse, had I committed a fix that spanned multiple files, some of them would have got to the branch and others not.So what, am I supposed to read e-mail before I can do a commit?  What if the mail does not arrive on time? What if the commit had affected many more directories and some of them had already been tagged but some not?This is just another example of CVS showing its limitations and stupidities.  Given that each file's history is stored independently — i.e. there are no global changesets — the only way to tag the repository is to go file by file and set the tag on each.  And then, you need to check which revision of each file is the one to be tagged.  I do not know why is this so slow even when you do a rtag (so the one doing the work is the server alone) on HEAD, but in the case of pkgsrc this process took more than 2 hours!OK, OK, I'm hiding the truth.  The thing is there are some ways around this: for example, using the tag command will tag the exact revisions you have in your working copy, or passing a date to rtag will tag the repository based on the provided timestamp.  This way you ensure that the tagging process will be consistent even if people keep committing changes to the tree.  However, the first of these commands will require a lot of network communication and the second will put a lot of stress on the server, making the command even slower (or that's what I've been told).In virtually all other version control systems that support changesets, a tag is just a name for a given revision identifier.  And defining this tag is a trivial and quick process.  Well, Subversion is rather different because tags are just copies of the tree, but I think that they deal with these efficiently.

        It is a new year again.Let's see if I can, at least, accomplish one goal: I should try to not delay stuff as much as I have been doing until now. This specially refers to replying to some e-mails and working on some stuff I once started but have not had the time to finish (bad excuses, I know). The clearest example that comes to my mind is Boost.Process, for which I have got many status-requests already... but there are also some tiny pet projects such as genfb support for NetBSD/mac68k and witheouts for tmpfs. Of course, there also is the conversion of more NetBSD tests to ATF.But, and this is a big but, the first semester of the year will probably keep me extremely busy with my Ph.D. courses... and, to make things worse, when I get home in the evening I'm so tired that I don't want to do more work. Will have to try to organize tasks a bit better so that there is time for everything.Anyway, happy new year to everyone!  And thanks to your continuous visits and support, this is the 400th post :-)

      <p>
        I'm currently using a 17" flat screen with the PlayStation 3 and, also, for my MacBook Pro in clamshell mode.  For the laptop, it is "reasonable" given that it has a similar resolution to the one of the built-in screen, but for the PlayStation 3 it simply sucks: I can only use it through the composite input, which results in very bad graphics quality. I also miss the 20" monitor I sold when I bought the MacBook Pro, which was very nice to watch videos and had lots of real screen state to work comfortably. So... I'm in the market for a widescreen computer monitor that natively supports Full HD (i.e. 1920x1080), and that brings me to the 24" world. These things are huge!Here are some things to take into account when looking for such a monitor:Resolution: All 24" computer monitors (not TVs) I've seen have so far have a 16:10 aspect ratio with a resolution of 1920x1200. Some 23" ones also have this same resolution, and I can assume that slightly bigger ones also will. But to support Full HD they need a minimum of 1920x1080.Response time: This is the time it takes to change the color of a pixel. Usually, the lower the better to prevent ghosting, but this is hard to qualify. Each vendor advertises this in a different way, because there are multiple measures that define the response time. For example: you can measure the time it takes for a pixel to go from white to black or from a tone of gray to another tone. Some vendors will only tell you the smallest one. The best specification is when the vendor provides you all different numbers.Brightness and contrast: All monitor specifications will give you some numbers about the brightness and contrast ratio of it. Be aware that there are two measurements for the contrast ratio: dynamic and static.Video inputs: There is a wide variety of rather cheap 24" monitors, but most of them are very limited in the inputs they support. The cheapest one I've found so far only has an analog VGA connection; avoid those. If you are going all the way up to a big monitor, do it right and use a digital connection; otherwise the image may be blurry or unstable.Virtually all other ones have a single digital DVI or HDMI input and an analog one. The most advanced have additional inputs, such as two digital connections (one DVI, one HDMI), a VGA analog one, composite, component, S-video, ... In this area, just choose the one that will suit your requirements, but the more connections they have, the more expensive they will be.HDCP support: If the monitor has digital inputs &mdash; DVI, but specially HDMI &mdash; make sure it supports HDCP. This is required to watch 1080p high-definition content; otherwise, players will only output 720p, which is half the resolution. So, to use the PlayStation 3 in its full power, you must have HDCP. And I assume that some computer media players also require this... or at least that's the idea I have about video playback in Windows Vista.1:1 pixel mapping: Widescreen computer monitors have an aspect ratio of 16:10, but game consoles and video players output video in 16:9. In terms of resolution, the monitors have 1920x1200 pixels but the video signal will only be 1920x1080. There are many monitors out there that will scale the 16:9 image to fill the whole 16:10 screen, which will distort it. If the monitor supports 1:1 pixel mapping, it will happily display the lower-resolution image on the screen without distortion, adding small black bars at the top and bottom of it.Now, looking for this feature in the vendors' sites is hard... if not impossible. I have not found any list of specifications that mentions it and have only been able to guess whether a given monitor supports it or not by looking at random forums around the Internet. And even then the answers are not very clear.Picture-in-Picture (PiP): This feature allows you to display two different video inputs at the same time on the monitor. One covers the whole display and the other one is shown in a window on top of it. All of this is done internally by the monitor.Vertical orientation: Some monitors allow you to tilt them vertically, thus providing a resolution of 1200x1920. I can't imagine how useful this is, but it might be nice to watch some specific photos that were taken in such orientation.Additional connectors: Look for extra USB or FireWire connections, ideally with extra power.Speakers/microphone: Some monitors include built-in speakers and/or a microphone. I personally do not care much about this because built-in speakers tend to produce low-quality sound. And with such a huge screen I assume you also want decent audio playback ;-)Built-in power supply: To avoid more clutter under your desk, you may want to check if the monitor has a built-in power supply or an external one.So, what am I looking for? I want a monitor with: at least two digital connections, preferably a DVI and an HDMI one; HDCP support; an analog input would be nice; 1:1 pixel mapping is a must; speakers are irrelevant. I've already made my choice and, hopefully, I'll get it today :-)  But on the next post I'll try to summarize some of the monitors I've analyzed.

        Been tracking and resolving a bug in Linux's SPU scheduler for the last three days, and fixed it just a moment ago!  I'm happy and needed to mention this ;-)More specifically, tracking it down was fairly easy using SystemTap and Paraver (getting the two to play well together was another source of headaches), but fixing it was the most complex thing due to deadlocks popping up over and over again.  Sorry, can't disclose more information about it yet; want to think a bit more how to make this public and whether my fix is really OK or not.  But be sure I will!

        I started this week's work with the idea of instrumenting the spufs module found in Linux/Cell to be able to take some traces of the execution of Cell applications.  At first, I modified that module to emit events at certain key points, which were later registered in a circular queue.  Then, I implemented a file in /proc so that a user-space application could read from it and free space from the queue to prevent the loss of events when it was full.That first implementation never worked well, but as I liked how it was evolving, I thought it could be a neat idea to make this "framework" more generic so that other parts of the kernel could use it.  I rewrote everything with this idea in mind and then also modified the regular scheduler and the process-management system calls to also rise events for my trace.  And got it working.But then, I was talking to Brainstorm about his new "Sun Campus Ambassador" position at the University, and during the conversation he mentioned DTrace.  So I asked... "Mmm, that tool could probably simplify all my work; is it there something similar for Linux?".  And yes; yes it is!  Its name, SystemTap.As the web page says, SystemTap "provides an infrastructure to      simplify the gathering of information about the running Linux         system". You do this by writing small scripts that hook into specific points of the kernel — at the function level, at specific mark points, etc. — and which get executed when the script is processed and installed into the live kernel as a loadable kernel module.With this tool I can discard my several-hundred-long changes to gather traces and replace them with some very, very simple SystemTap scripts.  No need to rebuild the kernel, no need to deal with custom changes to it, no need to rebuild every now and then... neat!Now I'm having problems using the feature that allows to instrument kernel markers, and I need them because otherwise some private functions cannot be instrumented due to compiler optimizations (I think).  OK, I'd expose those functions, but while I'm at it, I think it'd be a good idea to write a decent tapset for spufs that could later be published.  And that prevents me from doing such hacks.But anyway, kudos to the SystemTap developers.  I now understand why everybody is so excited about DTrace.

        I've had my MacBoook Pro for a bit over than 11 months.  Not so long ago, I remember that the battery lasted for more than three and a half hours when using the machine very lightly (some web browsing or some e-mail reading, for example), and for a bit over an hour with (very) heavy usage.  But recently, I started to notice that its capacity had shortened to alarming levels: it now only lasted for about an hour with the machine idle!  That didn't feel right for a machine that only had a year of life.After installing coconutBattery, I was scared to see that the battery only had 53% of its original capacity, and that was after a modest number of 80 full charge cycles.  Compared to several other similar machines with much higher cycles count and battery life, mine was in very bad condition.I don't know if that was due to a defective battery or misuse of it (like too much heat caused by the computer damaging it), but I'm inclined to think it's the former specially because I've read similar (well, worse) problems from people that bought this same machine around the same dates.Anyway, the thing is I went to an Apple Store on monday to explain the situation: they just took the battery, noted down the machine's serial number (no need to show the invoice!) and told me that they'd send me an SMS when they had resolved the problem.  And... today... I received that message.  Shiny new battery and no complaints from them!  Kudos to the service, again.
