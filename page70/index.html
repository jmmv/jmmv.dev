        I've uploaded GStreamer 0.10, the base plugins set and the good plugins set  to pkgsrc.  This new major version is parallel installable with the prior 0.8 series; this is why all the old packages have been renamed to make things clearer.Fortunately, this version was easier to package because it does not need a "plugin registry" as the previous one did (i.e., no need for install-time scripts).  Even though, the split of the plugins in different distfiles (base, good, bad, et. al.) make it a bit more complex.Let's now wait until someone packages Beep Media Player's development version and we'll be able to enjoy its features (assuming it works fine, of course...).I have to confess that I'm losing interest in maintaining the GNOME-related packages in pkgsrc.  They take me too much time, time that I'd rather spend on other NetBSD-related tasks.  This is why this update has been delayed so much...

        Yes, it is true!  (Although I haven't seen any anouncement yet; thanks to a friend for telling me.) Google's messaging service, Google Talk, can now communicate with other Jabber servers such as the popular jabber.org. It has always been a Jabber-based system, but its server didn't allow communications with third-party servers before.I think I'll migrate my account if this one proves to be stable; will be trying it for some days before to make sure :-)

        I've just decided to learn how to publish images in Blogger.  And in fact, it's damn easy, but for some reason I thought it was not &mdash; that is, I believed I had to register myself in some other service and was lazy to do it...Here come some pictures of my rig:The picture above shows my desktop.  You can see the iBook G4 working in clamshell mode (well, sort of).  It's connected to the Apple keyboard, to the mini mouse (I ought to replace it), to the BenQ FP202W flat pannel and to the stereo system.  If you can notice the free USB wire next to the laptop... that's my manual switch for the keyboard and mouse! ;-)  On the right side below the table is my PC, the Athlon XP 2600+ machine.  Oh, and there is the Palm m515, this month's DDJ issue and a 802.11 book I got recently.This other picture shows the machine I used during tmpfs development to do all the necessary tests.  It's a Pentium 2 233Mhz with 128Mb of RAM and is connected to the PC with a serial line (plus to the Ethernet, of course).  (I've been playing with qemu recently and I might get rid of it.)  Below the speaker (on the floor) is my old Viewsonic monitor that I'm trying to sell.At last, this other picture shows the Apple Macintosh Performa 630 I found a year and a half ago (no, the monitor is not currently connected).  It's waiting for a reinstall of NetBSD/mac68k. Ah, and there is also a VHS video on the left side of the table which is connected to the PC.Next time I shall publish pictures of the SoC and Monotone T-shirts ;-)

        IP networks communicate with each other using L3 devices named routers. A router has a table that tells itself how to reach a given network; i.e., if it has to communicate with another router or if it is directly attached to it. Obviously, these tables need to be filled with accurate information, a thing that can be done in two ways:Static routing: The network administrator manually fills in the required data in each router and/or host. This is tedious to do but is enough on (very) little networks. For bigger networks, this does not scale.Dynamic routing: The routing tables are automatically filled in by routing protocols, which are executed by the routers themselves. These are what concerns us in this post, which aims to provide a little overview of their classification.A routing protocol defines a set of rules and messages &mdash; in the typical sense of a network protocol &mdash; that allow routers to communicate with each other and make them automatically adapt to topology changes in the network. For example, when a new network is added, all routers will be notified to add an appropriate entry to their routing table, so that they can reach it; imagine something similar when a network becomes unavailable.We can classify these routing protocols in two major groups:Distance vector protocols: As the name implies, this protocol calculates a distance between two given routers. The metric used in this measure depends on the protocol used. For example, RIP counts the number of hops between nodes.  (This contrasts withe OSPF, which uses a per-link cost which might be related to, e.g., its speed.  Please note that OSPF is not a distance vector protocol; I'm mentioning it here to show that this difference in metrics can cause problems if you reinject routes between networks that use different protocols.)Another thing that differentiates these protocols is that the routers periodically send status messages to their neighbours. On some special cases, they may send a message as a result of an event without waiting for the specified interval to pass.Link state protocols: These protocols monitor the status of each link attached to the router and send messages triggered by these events, flooding the whole network. Another difference is that each router keeps a database that represents the whole network; from this database, it's then able to generate the routing table using an appropriate algorithm (such as Bellman-Ford or Dijkstra) to determine the best path. These include OSPF, BGP and IS-IS.At last, we can also classify these protocols in two more groups:Interior routing protocols: These are used inside autonomous system (AS) to maintain the tables of their internal routers. These protocols include OSPF and RIP.Exterior routing protocols: Contrary to the previous ones, these are used to communicate routing rules between different ASs. And why are they not the same as the previous ones?  Because they use very different metrics to construct the routing table: they rely on contracts between the ASs to decide where to send packets, something that cannot be taken into account with interior protocols. We can include BGP in this group.Edit (23:47): As Pavel Cahyna kindly points out, OSPF is not a distance vector protocol.  The error has splipped in because I wanted to state something but that confused me and didn't put it in the correct group.  The paragraph has been reworded.

        I've been playing with Apple's Backup utility (in trial mode) for a couple of days and it seems to be ideal for people like me: those who know that backups must be done but who never spend the time to do them.After opening it you get a dialog that lets you configure a backup plan.  A plan specifies the list of the items to back up, the backing up interval and the destination for the copy (be it a remote server, your iDisk, a local volume or a CD/DVD). Setting up the items to copy is trivial because the program offers you a set of predefined plan templates: copy personal settings, iLife data, purchased music or the whole home directory. Of course, you can configure these in a more fine-grained fashion, specifying whether your keychain, your bookmarks, your calendars, your photos, etc. should be copied or not.A few clicks later, the plan is created and the program will automatically take care to issue the backups at the predefined intervals. Related to this, here is one thing that is very useful: if the computer was off at the exact time the backup should have run, it will do the copy when it becomes on again. I wish cron(8) could do something similar, because desktop PCs are not up the whole day (I know there is anacron, but it'd be nice if the regular utility supported something similar).Unfortunately, the Backup utility is tied to .Mac. If you do not have a full account you are limited to 100MB per copy. And while the iDisk and this backup facility is very nice, I don't find it worth the money.What I'm now thinking is that having a similar free utility could be very nice. It'd perfectly fit GNOME in the name of usability! It'd be even nicer if it'd run in the background, detached from any graphical interface (so that you'd set it up and forget in a dedicated server). Hmm... looks like an interesting project; pity I don't have time for it anytime soon (too much long-overdue stuff to do).  Wondering if something like this already exists...

        You probably know it by now: Apple unleashed its first Intel-based computers yesterday during Steve Jobs' keynote.  The PowerBook has been replaced by a completely new model, named MacBook Pro.  It features a Yonah dual core processor plus a lot of other hardware updates and additions (some removals, too!); it won't be ready until February, but can be already ordered.  As regards desktop machines, the iMac has been updated; contrary to the laptop, this machine has suffered "less" updates, which include the processor (also dual-core) and the graphics card.  Otherwise, it's similar to the PPC model; externally, both seem to be the same.I've been looking forward to this announcement for a while &mdash this is why I'm posting it here.  I had expected (as many other people) that the first models to be converted could be the iBooks.  Frankly, I'm glad they didn't do it, because I won't feel bad for having bougth this G4 just a month and a half ago.  Don't get me wrong; it's working great ;-)Other news include the update of Mac OS X to 10.4.4 (which I'm already running :-) and the release of iLife'06 and iWork'06.I hope that NetBSD gets ported to these new machines and that it works as well as the i386 port.  If that's the case, I'll seriously consider a Mac as my next desktop machine (which is still some years away... and who knows what will happen in this time frame).Edit (17:07): I'm now wondering why the hell on earth many people seems to assume that Windows will run on these machines...  All they have done is change the microprocessor (OK, plus other things), but this does not mean it becomes an IBM-compatible system &mdash; just consider Amiga-based and Mac-based 68k systems.  I'm sure somebody will get it working, but it hasn't to be easy.Edit (20:14, 12th January): I stand corrected.  These Intel-based machines come with regular hardware as found on PC systems; i.e., they run standard Intel microprocessors and chipsets.  The major difference is that they use EFI (the Extensible Firmware Interface) instead of the obsolete BIOS.  Looks like Windows Vista will run on them directly (and Apple won't forbid it :-).  As regards NetBSD, support for EFI will be needed as well as (possibly) some new drivers.

        One of the things that I've come to love about Mac OS X is the way it handles the active applications. Let's first see what other systems do in order to talk about the advantages of this approach.All other desktop environments &mdash; strictly speaking, the ones I've used, which include GNOME, KDE and Windows &mdash; seem to treat a single window as the most basic object.  For example: the task manager shows all visible windows; the key bindings switch between individual windows; the menu bar belongs to a single window and an application can have multiple menu bars; etc.If you think about it, this behavior doesn't make much sense and this may be one of the reasons why Windows and KDE offer MDI interfaces. (Remember that an MDI interface is generally a big window that includes several other within it; the application is then represented by a single window, thus removing auxiliary windows &mdash; e.g., a tool palette &mdash, from the task switcher, etc.)  Unfortunately, other systems such as GTK/GNOME do not have this interface and the application's windows are always treated individually (just think how annoying it is to manage The GIMP).So, why is (IMHO) Mac OS X better in this aspect? This OS's interface always groups windows by the application they belong to. The dock (which is similar to a task bar, but better ;-) shows application icons; the task switcher (the thing that appears in almost any environment when you press Alt+Tab) lets you switch between applications, not windows; there is a single menu bar per application; etc. Whenever you select an application, all of its windows become active and are brought to the front layer automatically. In general, you have many different windows visible at a time, but they all belong to a rather small subset of applications. Therefore, this makes sense.At last, let me talk about the menu-bar-at-top-of-screen thing I mentioned above, which is what drove me to write this post in the first place. Before using a Mac, I always thought that having the menu bar detached from the window didn't make any sense, specially because different windows from a single applications often have different menus. I had even tried enabling a setting in KDE that simulates this behavior, but didn't convince me at all because the desktop as a whole doesn't follow the concept of treating applications as a unit, as described above (plus the applications are not designed to work in such a interface).However, after using Mac OS X for a while, I'm hooked to this "feature". Accessing the menu bar is a lot easier than when it is inside the window.  And being able to do some actions on the application, no matter which of its windows is visible, is nice. You must try it to understand my comments ;-)
