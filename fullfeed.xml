&lt;p>But uh&amp;hellip; wait, what is Kyua and why is this exciting? To resolve confusion and celebrate this milestone, I&amp;rsquo;d like to revisit what Kyua is, how it came to be, why I stopped working on it for a while, why that was a problem for FreeBSD&amp;mdash;and, indirectly, NetBSD&amp;mdash;and how Kyua being free software has helped keep it alive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-birth-of-atf">The birth of ATF&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s begin by talking about Kyua&amp;rsquo;s predecessor: the Automated Testing Framework (ATF).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2005, I was &lt;a href="/2005/06/soc-accepted.html">one of the lucky pioneers&lt;/a> of the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program. During that summer, I wrote &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071214080206/http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/tmpfs/">the tmpfs file system for NetBSD&lt;/a> and my development process went something like this on an iBook G3:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Modify the kernel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Build and install the updated kernel.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reboot the laptop.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Mount the file system.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Manually validate new functionality and bug fixes.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Witness the machine crash.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Force-reboot.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rinse and repeat.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Needless to say, this was a painful process. Using kernel modules lowered the pain a tiny little when the changes I made didn&amp;rsquo;t crash but, in general, they &lt;em>did&lt;/em> crash. Documentation was scarce and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I was doing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an attempt to make the validation step less painful and to ensure that each change I made was a &amp;ldquo;net positive&amp;rdquo; instead of regressing functionality, I got what-I-think-was my first real exposure to automated testing. I &lt;em>had&lt;/em> to automate steps 4 and 5 in the flow above, and so I wrote ad-hoc scripts to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My GSoC mentors, Luke Mewburn and Bill Studenmund, pointed me at the &lt;code>src/tests&lt;/code> directory of the NetBSD source tree which contained a bunch of tests for the system. Some of these were for user space tools and others exercised portions of the kernel. The existing machinery could probably be reused to automate my manual regression testing steps, so I had to try to integrate with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Machinery&lt;/em> is&amp;hellip; a strong word given how rudimentary &lt;code>src/tests&lt;/code> was. The main issue with this infrastructure was that the tests didn&amp;rsquo;t have a real runner: they were all small programs with unique command-line interfaces glued together by a collection of &lt;code>Makefile&lt;/code>s. There was no guarantee that these tests built nor that running a &lt;code>make test&lt;/code> would run them all because many tests were known to be broken. And what&amp;rsquo;s worse: some of the existing tests &lt;em>crashed&lt;/em> the kernel due to known bugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started envisioning the need for a principled test framework and wanted to create one, but I needed the time to do so and school didn&amp;rsquo;t give me much of that. So, in 2006, I applied once again to GSoC but, while I got in, I chose to take a detour and help write the beginnings of the Boost.Process library. The reason for this choice was primarily to learn Win32 internals but a good side-effect was that I got to experience a more advanced test framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then, in 2007, I wanted to create this automation project as my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree graduation project&amp;hellip; but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a professor that would back the idea. (A pity because I believe it would have been a great fit for the operating systems group.) So I did what I knew how to do: I applied and got into GSoC once again&amp;mdash;this time &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071225031924/http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/atf/">to develop a testing framework for NetBSD&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea was to create libraries to write tests with a unified CLI interface in either C, C++, or shell, and then provide a unified runner that would execute these tests in an isolated manner &lt;em>and&lt;/em> without access to the source tree. And thus the &lt;em>Automated Testing Framework (ATF)&lt;/em> was born.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="problems-with-atf">Problems with ATF&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>ATF was fine for a while. We got a large portion of the old tests in NetBSD resurrected, fixed, and hooked into the ATF infrastructure. A major contribution was Andreas Gustafsson&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.gson.org/netbsd/anita/">Anita&lt;/a>: an automation system to create a VM, install NetBSD on it via the interactive installer, and run the whole battery of tests inside of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anita and ATF were the beginnings of something akin to a CI system for a full operating system in the open source world. As far as I know, Linux did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> have anything similar&amp;mdash;and it &lt;em>couldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> have had anything similar due to the distributed nature of its development&amp;mdash;nor did the other BSDs. Windows &lt;em>did&lt;/em> have this, of course, as I could glance from the many articles in &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">The Old New Thing&lt;/a> describing backwards compatibility testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was great but, over time, ATF showed signs of suboptimal design. It had at least two problems that were really hard to fix, namely:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Its design (remember running &lt;code>atf-run | atf-report&lt;/code>?) prevented the execution of tests in parallel, and concurrent test execution is crucial for performance. The Anita test runs took just too long for a good CI turnaround.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>ATF expected tests to be written using the &lt;code>atf-c&lt;/code>, &lt;code>atf-c++&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>atf-sh&lt;/code> libraries&amp;mdash;but developers wanted to implement and reuse tests without porting them to these libraries. In particular, people wanted to create simpler test programs and wanted to support programs that emitted the more-widespread &lt;a href="https://testanything.org/">Test Anything Protocol (TAP)&lt;/a> popularized by Perl test harnesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Aside from these problems, ATF also lacked a critical feature that Anita had to supply on its own: a data store to track historical test reports and an interface to browse through them. This feature was a necessity for a CI system so, ideally, it had to live within ATF to not be stuck inside a web server. (&amp;ldquo;Web apps everywhere&amp;rdquo; was not a thing pre-2010.) To compound the problem, I got an internship at Google in 2008 and joined full-time in 2009, which let me experience &lt;a href="https://bazel.build/">Blaze&lt;/a> and its ecosystem for test results tracking and reporting first-hand&amp;mdash;and I wanted those features for NetBSD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I concluded, &lt;a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/">maybe wrongly&lt;/a>, that ATF needed a rewrite.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="kyua-arrives">Kyua arrives&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>So, in 2010, I set to create a brand new execution engine. At that point, the target was to rewrite just the portion of ATF that executed tests: that is, the &lt;code>atf-run | atf-report&lt;/code> pipeline. I did not want to recreate the ATF &lt;em>libraries&lt;/em>. The idea was to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Create a generic test runner that could integrate multiple test protocols, with the ATF-based tests being the first use case. The unwritten goal was to let the ATF libraries dwindle at some point in the future in favor of better libraries (like &lt;a href="https://github.com/google/googletest">GoogleTest&lt;/a> for C++ tests or my own &lt;a href="/2023/10/unit-testing-with-shtk.html">shtk for shell tests&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Support a &amp;ldquo;tests database&amp;rdquo; to store the results of all test executions. This database was going to allow generating reports in multiple formats and permit running queries to look at historical trends.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Support parallel test execution via a more modular runner design. (If you know the history behind Kyua, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that this feature only appeared very late in the game. It was a mistake to delay it and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why I did that.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Thus, in November of 2010, Kyua was born as a &amp;ldquo;testing framework for infrastructure software&amp;rdquo;. It took some work to get to the point where Kyua could run most of the NetBSD test suite unmodified, but by July 2011, I reached this milestone and launched Kyua 0.1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which led to frustration: ATF was deeply ingrained in NetBSD and Kyua wasn&amp;rsquo;t well-received for various reasons. One was that Kyua was a larger C++ project than ATF and C++ was (and still is) frowned upon in that community. Another was the fact that Kyua&amp;rsquo;s reports were harder to manage and required significantly more disk space, and Andreas wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready to bubble up his CI hardware costs. There were other concerns, all pretty reasonable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I kept working on Kyua to try to resolve most of the concerns raised and I believe I addressed all of those that could be addressed. Unfortunately, this took time, and I had grown demotivated to pursue another &amp;ldquo;sell&amp;rdquo; of the project. But then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="kyua-meets-freebsd">Kyua meets FreeBSD&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The FreeBSD community had been paying attention. They needed to improve their CI story as well, and they did have much more interest in building a test suite due to the needs of a few corporate-backed projects. I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure who I talked to other than Enji Cooper, George N. Neville, and Ed Maste, but by 2013, I had &lt;a href="/2013/11/joining-freebsd-committer-ranks.html">gotten a FreeBSD commit bit&lt;/a> and I was set to integrate Kyua&amp;mdash;not ATF!&amp;mdash;into FreeBSD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I remember was how the FreeBSD project offered me three dedicated beast machines in a colo so that I could set them up for CI runs. This felt very different from the NetBSD approach: FreeBSD had resources&amp;mdash;understandably so, as NetBSD has always been underrated&amp;mdash;and they were ready to invest them into the shiny-new thing. I took the bait and worked on that for a while. (Fun fact: I used a PowerMac G5 for this work.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By December of 2013, I shipped &lt;a href="/2013/12/introducing-freebsd-test-suite.html">the initial CI system&lt;/a> for FreeBSD. This was a really exciting moment because all efforts I had put behind Kyua finally paid off: Kyua was &lt;em>the&lt;/em> driver for what I think is the most important operating system project in the open source community outside the Linux monoculture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The future of the project was tainted though: I was still employed by Google&amp;hellip; which made me keep experiencing Blaze and its ecosystem day after day. You see: Blaze is often touted as a &lt;em>build&lt;/em> system, but its secret sauce lies in it being a &lt;em>test&lt;/em> system. Blaze is a test runner that knows how to precisely build and run &lt;em>the minimum set of tests impacted by a code change&lt;/em>. And this matters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Precise test selection doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a big difference for the run-off-the-mill projects you see in GitHub, but for monorepo-style projects&amp;mdash;and the BSDs are such projects&amp;mdash;this becomes a requirement to run a CI system with quick turnaround times. By this point, I saw Kyua as a &amp;ldquo;local maximum&amp;rdquo; because I did not see how to make this possible in combination with the native BSDs&amp;rsquo; build systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="stagnation">Stagnation&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>No matter what I secretly thought, FreeBSD was bought into ATF and Kyua, and they&amp;mdash;Enji in particular&amp;mdash;had larger plans for the system. The FreeBSD developers really wanted to integrate TAP-style tests, needed to set up a full CI system with many more configurations and architectures than I had set up, and needed better reporting capabilities for failures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem was that I owned the critical software pieces of this infrastructure, and this was a problem for various reasons: I was too busy with work and two little kids; I had stopped using any BSD on a daily basis; I did not see a bright future for Kyua as it was designed nor implemented; and to make things worse, contributing to Kyua required signing the Google CLA because I still worked for Google (which never made any sense to me but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a say in the matter).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, for years, Kyua went pretty much unmaintained. FreeBSD kept building local patches and occasionally sent PRs to my upstream project, but I dreaded dealing with them. Maintaining open source projects is stressful if only because of this guilt that you end up with when you don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to deal with contributions in a timely manner. The more time the situation lasts, the worse it gets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took until 2020 to convince myself that ATF and Kyua needed attention and that I was not fit to support them. I had to let go off these projects and I needed to clear my mind &lt;a href="https://www.endbasic.dev/2020/04/hello-endbasic.html">for other cool stuff&lt;/a>. So&amp;hellip; I emailed the FreeBSD project owners and offered them to take ownership. If they forked the project and owned it, any FreeBSD committer could easily gain access to the project to do what was best for FreeBSD. And if they owned the fork, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about the CLA part of the situation because I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be involved any longer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things didn&amp;rsquo;t make the progress I desired though. The FreeBSD project owners had concerns about officially forking these projects into FreeBSD because it cloud give the wrong impression and alienate other consumers like NetBSD. Kyua and ATF were not FreeBSD-only projects so it was probably better for them to stand alone. The discussions died off and stayed like that&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="rebirth">Rebirth&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip; until the end of 2023 when Li-Wen Hsu resurrected the email thread I had started. Kyua had become a critical piece of the FreeBSD quality infrastructure and it being almost-abandoned was starting to be problematic. He asked if we could move forward with the project ownership transfer idea&amp;mdash;and I was at the ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And so that&amp;rsquo;s what happened!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On January 17th, 2024, the right buttons were pushed and&amp;hellip; &lt;a href="https://github.com/freebsd/kyua/">Kyua&lt;/a> (along with &lt;a href="https://github.com/freebsd/atf/">ATF&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/freebsd/lutok/">Lutok&lt;/a>) all became owned by the &lt;a href="https://github.com/freebsd/">FreeBSD GitHub organization&lt;/a>. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a flurry of PRs reviewed and merged into the project, which makes me happy, really, because the people that care now have the chance to do what&amp;rsquo;s best for the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, you know what? Even if Kyua has some &amp;ldquo;design flaws&amp;rdquo; because it was not designed to be exactly like Blaze, it does have some &lt;em>other&lt;/em> interesting ideas that make it a good-enough fit for FreeBSD. In particular, one design principle behind ATF and Kyua was to allow running a test suite &lt;em>without&lt;/em> having access to the source code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Actually, I think this was a killer idea in the original design of ATF. The motivation for &amp;ldquo;running tests without the source&amp;rdquo; was to allow installing a system from scratch and then let &lt;em>the end user&lt;/em> run the tests to verify that the system worked correctly &lt;em>on their specific software/hardware combination&lt;/em>. The BSDs have limited resources and cannot do the sorts of testing that e.g. Microsoft does with Windows so, by pushing the tests &amp;ldquo;to the edge&amp;rdquo;, users could fill that gap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And to illustrate this novel-at-the-time idea, let&amp;rsquo;s take a tour.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="kyua-in-freebsd-14">Kyua in FreeBSD 14&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Kyua is part of the FreeBSD base system and, as such, it is installed under &lt;code>/usr/bin/kyua&lt;/code> and is available out of the box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly, the test suite is available under &lt;code>/usr/tests&lt;/code> if you choose to unpack &lt;code>tests.txz&lt;/code> during the system installation. Peeking under it, we find:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-plain" data-lang="plain">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">/usr/tests$ ls -F
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Kyuafile conftest.py lib/ sys/
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">README etc/ libexec/ usr.bin/

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">/usr/tests$ █
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We can use &lt;code>kyua list&lt;/code> to see what kind of test coverage we have. This command prints one test case name per line in its default output format, so we can easily count how many tests there are:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-plain" data-lang="plain">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">/usr/tests$ kyua list | wc -l
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> 8246
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">/usr/tests$ █
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>8000+ tests. Not bad! Let&amp;rsquo;s peek into a tiny sample by focusing on the tests for &lt;code>dd(1)&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-plain" data-lang="plain">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">/usr/tests$ kyua list bin/dd

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">/usr/tests$ █
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And let&amp;rsquo;s run those!&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">/usr/tests$ █
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Easy peasy. We can run tests for any part of the system right from the &lt;code>/usr/tests&lt;/code> hierarchy without having had to build anything nor needing access to the source tree. As mentioned earlier, you can use this feature to validate that FreeBSD works on your specific machine given that device drivers are of varying quality (something that&amp;rsquo;s true on &lt;em>any&lt;/em> operating system) and may result in different behavior. And you can use this feature to validate that the system &lt;em>continues to work&lt;/em> as you perform upgrades over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outside of your machine, though, we can also look at the CI system based on Jenkins. For that, head to &lt;a href="https://ci.freebsd.org/">https://ci.freebsd.org/&lt;/a> and peek around. Notice the tens of different jobs configured to build and test FreeBSD under various architectures, releases, and build settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an example, look at the recent &lt;a href="https://ci.freebsd.org/job/FreeBSD-main-amd64-test/25361/testReport/">run 25361 of &lt;code>FreeBSD-main-amd64-test&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, and notice how we can inspect the same test results we saw on the command line. Do so by clicking on &lt;a href="https://ci.freebsd.org/job/FreeBSD-main-amd64-test/25361/testReport/bin.dd/">&lt;code>bin.dd&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and finding the results for the same tests we ran earlier. This showcases Kyua&amp;rsquo;s ability to generate a &lt;code>junit.xml&lt;/code> test report&amp;mdash;an output format that was precisely written to integrate with Jenkins for the FreeBSD CI system.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The morale of the story is two-fold. First, free software can remain alive and kicking even if the original authors lose interest. And second&amp;hellip; do you see how powerful it is to have a CI system for &lt;em>a whole OS&lt;/em>? This is something Linux can only dream of because of its inherent distributed development nature. Yes, there is the &lt;a href="https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp">Linux Test Project&lt;/a>, but because Linux is &amp;ldquo;just a kernel&amp;rdquo;, this is what this project can test. There is nothing that can validate that the kernel works in combination with all other pieces that form a Linux distribution in a uniform and cohesive manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, congrats grads. Kyua has a bright future ahead.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-08-02-kyua-graduates.jpg" length="367311" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Rust doesn't solve the CrowdStrike outage</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/07/crowdstrike-and-rust.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 07:10:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/07/crowdstrike-and-rust.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Look, I like Rust. I really, really do, and I agree with the premise that memory-unsafe languages like C++ should not be used anymore. But claiming that Rust would have &lt;em>prevented&lt;/em> the massive outage that the world went through last Friday is misleading and actively harmful to Rust&amp;rsquo;s evangelism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having CrowdStrike written in Rust would have &lt;em>minimized&lt;/em> the chances of the outage happening, but not resolved the root cause that allowed the outage to happen in the first place. Thus, it irks me to see various folks blanket-claiming that Rust is the answer. It&amp;rsquo;s not, and pushing this agenda hurts Rust&amp;rsquo;s adoption more than it helps: C++ experts can understand the root cause and see that this claim is misleading, causing further divide in the systems programming world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, why won&amp;rsquo;t Rust help? Let me try to answer that question, but while we are at it, let&amp;rsquo;s also delve deeper into the causes of the outage. In a way, let me put my SRE hat on and write my own version of the postmortem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-outage">The outage&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Here is what &lt;a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/falcon-update-for-windows-hosts-technical-details/">CrowdStrike&amp;rsquo;s official &amp;ldquo;postmortem&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> has to say about the problem that the industry faced:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>On July 19, 2024 at 04:09 UTC, as part of ongoing operations, CrowdStrike released a sensor configuration update to Windows systems. Sensor configuration updates are an ongoing part of the protection mechanisms of the Falcon platform. This configuration update triggered a logic error resulting in a system crash and blue screen (BSOD) on impacted systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sensor configuration update that caused the system crash was remediated on Friday, July 19, 2024 05:27 UTC.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Paraphrasing:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>CrowdStrike (the company) pushed a configuration change.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The change tickled a latent bug in &amp;ldquo;the Falcon platform&amp;rdquo; (the product).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This bug in Falcon resulted in a crash that brought down Windows.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The first two points are not too strange: configuration changes are &amp;ldquo;business as usual&amp;rdquo; for any online system and having changes tickle bugs in code is unfortunately common. In fact, the majority of the outages (citation needed) are caused by human-initiated configuration changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, we should ask why the bug existed and how it could be remediated in order to increase the robustness of the product. But we must also question the third point: why was the bug able to bring down the whole machine? And, much more importantly, why did this bug bring down &lt;em>so many systems&lt;/em> across the world?&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-memory-bug">The memory bug&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the first question: what was the nature of the bug in Falcon?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Easy: there was a logic bug in the &amp;ldquo;Channel Files&amp;rdquo; (aka configuration files) parser that, given some invalid input, made the code try to access an invalid memory position. The details are really not interesting: this could be have been a null pointer dereference, a general protection fault, or whatever. The point is: the crash was triggered by an invalid memory access issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And this is where some Rust enthusiasts will zero in and say &amp;ldquo;Ah-HAH! We got you, fools. If the code had been written in Rust, this bug would not have existed!&amp;rdquo; And, you know what, that&amp;rsquo;s literally true: this specific bug would not have happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But so what? Avoiding this specific type of error would just have delayed this outage until another time when a different class of error that Rust doesn&amp;rsquo;t protect against happened. (This is the exact same argument I raised in a &lt;a href="/2018/07/forbidden-assertions-fallacy.html">critique of forbidding assertions in Go&lt;/a> back in 2018 by the way.) Focusing on the memory bug is missing the forest for the trees because of the nature of what Falcon is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK so, what is Falcon?&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-kernel-crash">The kernel crash&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Falcon is &amp;ldquo;malware&amp;hellip; but for the good guys&amp;rdquo;. Oops, I mean: Falcon is an endpoint security system. Falcon is a product typically installed on corporate machines so that the security team can detect and mitigate threats in real time (while monitoring the actions of their employees). There &lt;em>is&lt;/em> some value in this: most cyberattacks (citation needed again) start by compromising corporate machines, often via social engineering practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This type of product must have control over the machine. It must be able to intercept all user file and network operations to scan their content. And it must be tamper-proof so that &amp;ldquo;savvy&amp;rdquo; corporate users don&amp;rsquo;t disable it when they read sketchy online instructions to fix their broken WiFi in an attempt to (&lt;em>shudder&lt;/em>) not have to create IT tickets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How can you &lt;em>implement&lt;/em> a product like Falcon? The easiest approach, and the approach that Windows encourages, is to write a kernel module. It easily follows that Falcon is a kernel module and, as such, it runs in kernel space. This means that any mess up in Falcon&amp;rsquo;s code can damage the running kernel and, in turn, bring the whole system down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And when I say &amp;ldquo;any mess up&amp;rdquo;, I really mean it. The kernel is not only brought down by memory errors, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to &amp;ldquo;crash the kernel&amp;rdquo; to make a machine unusable. Think of a deadlock preventing the kernel from making forward progress. Think of a logic error in the &lt;code>open(2)&lt;/code> system call handler preventing user space from opening any file later on. Think of mistakenly mapping file system code as pageable when it should never be paged out. Think of writing an unbounded recursive algorithm that exhausts the kernel&amp;rsquo;s stack. Think of&amp;hellip; an innocent buggy &lt;code>unwrap()&lt;/code> call if the code actually used Rust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are just too many ways to destroy the kernel&amp;rsquo;s stability, which is why claiming that Rust would have prevented this incident irks me. Rust&amp;rsquo;s memory-safety only addresses one type of crash. It is true, though, that the focus on correctness in the Rust ecosystem via strong types could minimize the chances of other types of logic bugs. But&amp;hellip; as much as we want to reach perfection, we must accept that bugs happen, and asserting that Rust is &lt;em>the only answer&lt;/em> to the problem is as negligent as sticking to C++.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And, you know, there are many more C++ developers that work in kernel space than Rust developers know kernel internals (oops, another citation need). So, naturally, a large portion of C++ developers can smell the rubbish in this claim. Which is unfortunate because this increases animosity between the two communities, which goes against the goal of converting folks to safe languages. Rust folks &lt;em>know&lt;/em> that Rust can definitely help make the situation better, but C++ folks cannot get bought into it because the arguments they hear don&amp;rsquo;t resonate with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="from-kernel-space-to-user-space">From kernel space to user space&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>There have &lt;em>also&lt;/em> been other claims saying that this would not have happened at all if Falcon was &lt;em>not&lt;/em> running in the kernel. OK, that&amp;rsquo;s a better take, but&amp;hellip; it is not crystal-clear that this alone would help either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I mentioned earlier, Falcon needs to be as tamper-proof as possible to prevent malware from interfering with it and compromised users from trying to disable it. And if malware or humans were able to easily do that, then the product would be as useless as nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, the Windows kernel could definitely forbid kernel modules for anything similar to Falcon. Instead, the kernel could expose a bunch of APIs so that user space applications could hook into them to expose similar functionality. And you know what? Microsoft &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2009/12/16/microsoft-statement-on-european-commission-decision/">&lt;em>did&lt;/em> try to move Windows in that direction&lt;/a>, but the antivirus mob threatened to sue on antitrust grounds and the whole thing went nowhere. So we are stuck with a less secure system because antivirus companies need to be able to sell their obnoxious products.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But let&amp;rsquo;s step aside from that dumpster fire for a moment. Even if Falcon ran in user space and communicated with the kernel via controlled APIs&amp;hellip; would that be sufficient to prevent a system malfunction? Note that these APIs would need to be tamper-proof too. Imagine if, say, you wanted this user space driver to validate every binary before it&amp;rsquo;s executed by the kernel. If you make the kernel &lt;em>require&lt;/em> an answer from the user space driver on every execution, and such driver is faulty, the system won&amp;rsquo;t be able to execute any program anymore. And if you make it &lt;em>optional&lt;/em> for the kernel to communicate with the driver so that the kernel can tolerate a crashing driver, then you open up a path for malware to try to crash the driver first and then infiltrate the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus it is not obvious that &amp;ldquo;just moving to user space&amp;rdquo; is the answer here either. Oh, by the way, Apple has been moving macOS in the direction of disallowing kernel modules for years and providing alternative APIs to implement things like file systems and antivirus-type software without kernel privileges. They also have this kind of security daemon running in user space in the default system which validates process executions, and &lt;a href="/2017/10/fighting-execs-sandboxfs-macos.html">drove me crazy a while back&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-bug-is-in-the-deployment">The bug is in the deployment&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If we must accept that bugs exist, that memory-related bugs are not the only ones that can kill a system, and that moving the driver to user space isn&amp;rsquo;t an obvious fix either&amp;hellip; are we doomed? Is there nothing we could do to prevent this from happening?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above are all things that could (and should!) be done to reduce the chances of a misbehavior happening, but we must accept that the code bug was just &lt;em>the specific trigger this time around&lt;/em> and a different trigger could have had similarly nefarious consequences. The root cause behind the outage lies in the &lt;em>process&lt;/em> to get the configuration change shipped to the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, SRE 101 (or DevOps or whatever you want to call it) says that configuration changes must be staged for slow and controlled deployment, and validated at every step. Those changes should first be validated in a very small scale before being pushed to the world later on, and every push should be incremental.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find it quite hard to believe that CrowdStrike has nothing to validate deployments given the criticality of Falcon and the massive impact that a bug can have (and has had). Maybe they don&amp;rsquo;t have any process whatsoever as the external evidence seems to suggest, which would be incredibly negligent, &lt;del>but let&amp;rsquo;s give them the benefit of the doubt&lt;/del>. (&lt;strong>Update July 24th:&lt;/strong> According to CrowdStrike&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/">updated postmortem&lt;/a>, they actually do not have any sort of testing nor canarying. So it is indeed incredibly negligent.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Part of why I say this is due to new information from Microsoft with an assessment of how many machines were impacted by the outage. Here is &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/20/helping-our-customers-through-the-crowdstrike-outage/">what Microsoft has to say&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>While software updates may occasionally cause disturbances, significant incidents like the CrowdStrike event are infrequent. We currently estimate that CrowdStrike’s update affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or less than one percent of all Windows machines. While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Read that: &amp;ldquo;less than 1% of the machines were impacted&amp;rdquo;. Does this mean that CrowdStrike &lt;em>does&lt;/em> have a staged rollout in which they push configuration changes to just a subset of 1% of the machines worldwide? That doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem crazy actually and is in line with how many services are deployed, but if that&amp;rsquo;s their &lt;em>first&lt;/em> step in the deployment process, it&amp;rsquo;s time to reevaluate their approach because this 1% of machines is way too many and has proven to be catastrophic. (This is leaving aside the question of whether 1% refers to the total number of Windows machines in the world or 1% of Windows machines with CrowdStrike on them.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The question that remains answering, then, is what sort of testing happened between &amp;ldquo;the configuration change is done&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s roll it out to 1% of the world&amp;rdquo;. &lt;em>Did any testing happen at all?&lt;/em> That&amp;rsquo;s where it gets concerning and where we may not get any official information on the matter from CrowdStrike. (&lt;strong>Update July 24th:&lt;/strong> We did get &lt;a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/falcon-content-update-remediation-and-guidance-hub/">an update&lt;/a> and it confirms that they actually do not have any sort of rollout progressive deployment.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, yes, CrowdStrike&amp;rsquo;s deployment practices are definitely to blame for the incident. This outage &lt;em>was a process problem&lt;/em>, not &lt;em>a code/technology problem&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="downstream-companies">Downstream companies&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Before concluding, let&amp;rsquo;s shift away from CrowdStrike and look at the downstream companies impacted by this bad configuration push. Did you notice how many companies were absolving themselves from problems by pointing out that &amp;ldquo;due to a third-party IT incident&amp;rdquo; their service was down? OK, yes, that is literally true once again, but pointing fingers is not helpful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem in this situation is the monoculture around CrowdStrike. Certain security certifications require &amp;ldquo;endpoint protection&amp;rdquo; as a line item and it seems perfectly plausible that most IT departments just deploy Falcon due to aggressive marketing from CrowdStrike&amp;rsquo;s part and call it a day without putting any more thought into it. It&amp;rsquo;s just not interesting to them to spend any extra time on the issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this raises a problem: dependencies are always a liability, and when you choose to take a dependency on another vendor or another piece of code, you must own your choice. You must model how your own system will fail when the dependency fails, and then, if the risk warrants it, engineer a solution around the potential problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do not know how Falcon works, so I cannot tell if CrowdStrike offered sufficient clarity on how upgrades work to customers or even if their product offers a way to control how the deployment of configuration changes happens within an organization. These are things that will have to be built so that the few customers that care can increase the reliability of their systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="is-there-an-attack-vector">Is there an attack vector?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>And finally, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the last part of CrowdStrike&amp;rsquo;s official statement:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This issue is not the result of or related to a cyberattack.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Is that true? We may never know. It is unlikely that this &lt;em>is&lt;/em> a cyberattack because crashing systems left and right doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to serve a clear purpose. I guess you could claim that an attacker may have wanted to hide something &lt;em>else&lt;/em> while the world was scrambling, and that might be possible, but&amp;hellip; well, you can imagine all sorts of conspiracy theories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What &lt;em>is&lt;/em> interesting is this part of CrowdStrike&amp;rsquo;s official postmortem:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Although Channel Files end with the SYS extension, &lt;em>they are not kernel drivers&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Emphasis theirs. Funny, huh? They seem to be wanting to hide the fact that Falcon doesn&amp;rsquo;t run in the kernel. But it does. Knowing that these files are not drivers is not comforting: the kernel module is reacting to changes to these files and thus these files influence the behavior of the kernel. As a result, it seems plausible that malformed Channel Files could tamper with the kernel in more subtle ways than just a blatant crash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And &lt;em>this&lt;/em> situation, my friend, is precisely where Rust would definitely help. Rust&amp;rsquo;s memory safety would minimize the chances that a malformed configuration file could exploit bugs like buffer overflows to escalate privileges within the kernel, resulting in much more subtle, but dangerous, attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But that&amp;rsquo;s not what happened this time around.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-07-23-rusty-crow.jpg" length="343660" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>20 years of blogging</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/06/20-years-of-blogging.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/06/20-years-of-blogging.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blogsystem5.substack.com/">Blog System/5&lt;/a> hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been called this way and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been my first experience with blogging either. In fact, today marks the 20th anniversary of this publication in its various incarnations so it&amp;rsquo;s time for a bit of reflection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just to set context for when 20 years ago was: Windows XP was almost 3 years old, Ubuntu had just debuted, Apple computers were still PowerPC-based, Half Life 2 was about to launch, and Slashdot was the place to be instead of the yet-to-be-created Hacker News. As for myself, I was still in college, had copious amounts of free time, and was a really active contributor to NetBSD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So let&amp;rsquo;s start with a trip down memory lane before getting into the retrospective and the analysis of how &lt;a href="/2023/10/hello-blog-system5.html">my Substack experiment&lt;/a>, which started late last year, has turned out. Beware that because this is an introspection post, all of the generalizations that follow are backed by feelings, not hard data, so take them with a grain of salt.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="history-episode-one">History: Episode one&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Looking back at &lt;a href="/2004/06/welcome-to-my-new-journal.html">my very first post from June 22nd, 2004&lt;/a>&amp;mdash;oh wow, my English was &lt;em>bad&lt;/em>&amp;mdash;I had an earlier experiment of a blog a few months prior that didn&amp;rsquo;t last more than three entries. But the newer iteration, started during college finals of course, did stick. I originally chose the LiveJournal platform because it had more features than Blogger, and thus &amp;ldquo;jmmv&amp;rsquo;s weblog&amp;rdquo; was born. Why &amp;ldquo;weblog&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo;? Because the &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; term wasn&amp;rsquo;t yet the popular one.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041126220647/http://www.livejournal.com:80/users/jmmv/">&lt;img src="/images/2024-06-22-livejournal-20041126.png" class="with-border">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>Earliest image available of the "jmmv's weblog" site on LiveJournal via the Wayback Machine. Scraped on November 26th, 2004.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>My choice of LiveJournal didn&amp;rsquo;t last very long though. I migrated to Blogger on &lt;a href="/2005/10/blog-migrated-to-blogger-welcome.html">October 22nd, 2005&lt;/a> because it had improved significantly by then and it was growing in popularity. As part of that transition, I renamed the blog to &amp;ldquo;The Julipedia&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;a nickname that a friend gave me because I usually had answers to all of his Linux-related questions. And yes, Wikipedia was a pretty new thing back then too, having just launched in 2001 and still being mocked as &amp;ldquo;the thing that will never compete with real encyclopaedias&amp;rdquo;. Ha, ha.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;figcaption>Earliest image available of "The Julipedia" site on Blogger via the Wayback Machine. Scraped on April 12th, 2006.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Blogger was just fine for a long time&amp;hellip; until Google+ messed things up in 2011 or so. During that era, Google was shoehorning their social platform everywhere, and part of that process was optionally injecting the commenting system of Google+ into Blogger. I took the bait and adopted the new commenting experience&amp;mdash;which, in other words, meant that I killed engagement overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, I continued to hold onto Blogger until about 2015. At that point, Medium was the new hot thing and, having grown disillusioned with Blogger&amp;rsquo;s staleness&amp;mdash;the platform didn&amp;rsquo;t receive any love because all development and product resources had gone into the dwindling Google+&amp;mdash;&lt;a href="/2015/05/hello-medium.html">I gave it a try&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160701041554/https://medium.com/@jmmv">&lt;img src="/images/2024-06-22-medium-20160701.png" class="with-border">&lt;/a>
&lt;figcaption>Earliest image available of my Medium publication via the Wayback Machine. Scraped on July 1st, 2016.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Medium was great: its UI was &lt;em>neat&lt;/em> and their value proposition was that their network would help me increase the reach of my articles while offering a delightful publishing experience. But things went downhill pretty quickly too: the desire to monetize Medium made it gain aggressive subscription popups and paywalls everywhere, and it started filling up with &amp;ldquo;Top N things to XYZ&amp;rdquo; spam. AI-generated garbage? Not yet, but close. Yikes SEO.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="history-episode-two">History: Episode two&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>My Medium experiment &lt;a href="/2016/01/medium-experiment-wrapup.html">didn&amp;rsquo;t last very long&lt;/a>. I published 8 posts over the course of 5 months but I knew I had to move elsewhere. Part of this move involved exporting those 8 posts and reimporting them into Blogger, which was easier said than done. Medium offered an &amp;ldquo;export&amp;rdquo; feature indeed, which sold me in the first place to try it out, but the &lt;em>content&lt;/em> of the export was &lt;em>unusable&lt;/em>. It took a lot of effort to clean up the tainted HTML that the platform produced to reimport it anywhere else. And this is when it hit me: I was not in control of my content, which was validated by seeing that Blogger&amp;rsquo;s export suffered from the same issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which drove me to static hosting. &lt;a href="/2016/05/homepage-v3.html">I extended the trivial homepage I already had&lt;/a> on the web with a blog section, built with Jekyll first and &lt;a href="/2018/02/from-jekyll-to-hugo.html">then with Hugo&lt;/a>, and managed my blog in there for about 8 years. I dabbled with going back to a CMS a few times because the authoring experience in Markdown+Git+Hugo isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly&amp;hellip; amenable to posting. But every time I prototyped an alternative, I ended up hitting the same roadblocks around content ownership. I wanted to own the originals in a future-proof format.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;figcaption>Earliest image available of my static blog via the Wayback Machine. Scraped on December 24th, 2016.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>But wait&amp;hellip; you are reading this in Substack, aren&amp;rsquo;t you? &amp;ldquo;WTH!&amp;rdquo; you must be thinking. How can I reconcile what I just said with publishing on this platform? Well&amp;hellip; over the 8 years of static hosting, it was almost impossible for me to grow my blog&amp;rsquo;s readership. I tried various things to grow a subscribers base, but nothing worked. And Substack seemed to be the new cool kid on the block where various folks I follow post content, so I had to try it out. This experiment is &lt;a href="/2023/10/hello-blog-system5.html">what brought you Blog System/5 in the first place&lt;/a>. And you know what? It has been pretty cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key difference between the Substack experiment and the Medium experiment is that I&amp;rsquo;m authoring the content in Markdown first, using the exact same platform I had previously set up for my static blog. Only when the posts are ready to publish, I literally copy/paste them into Substack and then set up a redirect in my static blog to point to Substack. It&amp;rsquo;s painful indeed, but I feel at peace because I can pull the rug at any time and be back in my happy static blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="evolution-writing-approach">Evolution: Writing approach&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Anyhow, enough talk about the history of the blog. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how its content has changed form over the years and &lt;em>why&lt;/em> it has had to change. And to talk about content changes, we must talk about the evolution of audience behaviors: if you care about being read at all, you must consider who you are writing for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that in mind, the obvious question is: do people care about blogs these days? I&amp;rsquo;d say no, not really. Proof of this is when you hear people say &amp;ldquo;so and so wrote a blog&amp;rdquo; (cringe) when they actually mean &amp;ldquo;a blog &lt;em>post&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;. The concept of a blog as a personal publication seems to have been lost in favor of individual posts. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can think of some recent popular articles that came your way, but, question: can you remember &lt;em>where&lt;/em> you read them or &lt;em>who&lt;/em> the author was? I bet not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a consequence, the type of content for a long-running blog like this one has had to evolve. Take a moment to skim &lt;a href="/archive.html">through the archives&lt;/a> and look for patterns. You might notice that, back when I started blogging, my usual article was about 350 words long and not very polished. This was pretty common in the blogosphere: most blogs had similar short articles, often just describing the author&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;daily doings&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-06-22-blog-words-per-post.png" class="with-border">
&lt;figcaption>Median words per post by year for all articles that I've written in this blog and other publications.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Fast-forward to today and you can clearly see a change in the shape of the articles you read here and elsewhere: they are &lt;em>much&lt;/em> longer now, even if attention spans are infinitesimally small. One reason is that we used to use blogs like a social network, to publish our &amp;ldquo;daily doings&amp;rdquo; for our committed followers to see. Contrast that to today: there is almost zero chance anyone will come across a bunch of short articles frequently enough for them to become an avid reader. The other reason, closely related to this one, is that it&amp;rsquo;s easier for long-form posts to &amp;ldquo;go viral&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and while you might not care about reach, some of us do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing longer-form posts has had a direct inverse consequence on the frequency of the posts though, for obvious reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-06-22-blog-posts-per-year.png" class="with-border">
&lt;figcaption>Total number of posts per year in this blog, but also including occasional articles in other publications.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Having to dedicate many, &lt;em>many&lt;/em>, &lt;strong>&lt;em>many&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> hours to every long-form post necessarily means that the frequency of the articles has to decrease. For this blog, you can clearly see that I started strong with a post about every two or three days and now I consider myself lucky if I am able to average two posts per month per year. I also have much less free time available, so whenever I write an article, I want it to be of higher quality than before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fewer articles is not a bad metric per se though. Investing time to write long-form prose is beneficial. Long articles require much more work to put together indeed, but I find that spending such time helps me understand each topic in a better way. Furthermore, one only gets better at writing by, surprise, writing: if you skim through the oldest articles, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that they were, ehem, mediocre&amp;mdash;yet I made the conscious decision to blog and to do so in English. As a result, I think that my contemporary copy is pretty decent, and this has helped me immensely in my professional environment. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have gotten here without going through this long journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other big difference in how the content has evolved is the presence of pictures:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;figcaption>Evolution of the number of posts that include images over time.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In the past, I rarely included pictures in any article: these were not necessary because the articles were shorter and because resharing articles in social media didn&amp;rsquo;t require pictures to fight for the small chance of being seen. These days, however, you must have pictures in order to make articles stand out when they are shared. And just due to the nature of the longer text, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to include pictures, diagrams or code snippets to break the wall of text and make the copy easier to digest. Shout out to &lt;a href="https://draw.io/">draw.io&lt;/a>, which has been awesome to create diagrams in some recent posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="evolution-consumption-and-audience">Evolution: Consumption and audience&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Shifting gears a little bit, blogs were the true decentralized platform. Any individual could easily start a blog in the service of their choice, possibly self-hosting it if they didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use a commercial service, and anyone could trivially subscribe to those blogs via one of many RSS aggregators. And, yes, I know, this is true today as well: you can &lt;em>still&lt;/em> create a blog and you can &lt;em>still&lt;/em> subscribe to (most) blogs via RSS; however, the way blogs are &amp;ldquo;consumed&amp;rdquo; has changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that was useful in the past were the so-called &amp;ldquo;Planets&amp;rdquo;: websites that acted as curated aggregators of blogs by topic. Some of these still exist, such as &lt;a href="https://planet.kde.org">Planet KDE&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://fedoraplanet.org/">Planet Fedora&lt;/a>, but they don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> like they used to. The longer posts and the (ab)use of images has made Planets unwieldy: their front pages are extremely long and contain lots of irregularly-formatted pictures, offering little content cohesion. Years ago, because articles were shorter, more fit in one page, and because Planets were popular, authors often replied to each other&amp;rsquo;s &lt;del>controversial&lt;/del> interesting thoughts by posting on &lt;em>their&lt;/em> platform and seeing their articles bubble up through the Planets. Much like a social media timeline these days but without a central authority.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, without RSS aggregators or Planets, how do people find blogs now and &lt;em>stay engaged&lt;/em>? Well&amp;hellip; they don&amp;rsquo;t for the most part? Organic traffic is pretty much useless at building any kind of following: people come in, read the very few words they were looking for, and vanish right away. Gathering traffic from self-promotion in social media is almost a futile experiment. So the best bet is to have articles turn into &amp;ldquo;one-off hits&amp;rdquo; on sites like Hacker News. But even then, the majority of the traffic from those sources ends up being noise as well because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t lead to conversions into frequent readers. Getting content seen by a reasonable number of people is a fight with every single post.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-06-22-blog-views.png" class="with-border">
&lt;figcaption>Traffic to my blog during the second half of 2022 as captured by &lt;a href="https://endtracker.azurewebsites.net/">my own analytics platform&lt;/a>. I selected this period to avoid conflating the data with the creation of Blog System/5 and to avoid a humongous traffic spike driven by the &lt;a href="/2023/06/fast-machines-slow-machines.html">Fast machines, slow machines&lt;/a> post that made the other lines impossible to read. Note how there is no growth: the peaks are driven purely by Hacker News and the like.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>What am I basing this on? Well, for starters, my blog has had email subscriptions for more than 10 years, first powered by FeedBurner and then by &lt;a href="/2023/06/in-house-email-subscriptions.html">my own mechanism&lt;/a>. In that period of time, I only saw the subscribers count rise to about 170, which feels pretty pathetic to be honest. I resisted the urge to add &amp;ldquo;on-your-face&amp;rdquo; subscription popups, but the lack of those, the fact that some people are &amp;ldquo;invisible&amp;rdquo; because of RSS aggregators, and the fact that readers had to subscribe to the blog via obscure platforms&amp;hellip; well, there have few incentives to opt into potential email spam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now compare this past multi-year effort of a self-hosted blog with custom email subscriptions to what I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced on Substack since the launch of Blog System/5:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-06-22-substack-subscribers.png" class="with-border">
&lt;figcaption>Subscribers growth during the first 6 months of Blog System/5's existence. I pretty much paused publishing in March to focus on other side projects and thus haven't seen any major growth since.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I created Blog System/5 in late October 2023 and by March 2024 I had already amassed 700+ subscribers. It&amp;rsquo;s also true that I was lucky to have a few articles spread through Hacker News and other sites, and that I put a lot more effort in crafting these than what I wrote in the past, but still: using a platform that people know, that is focused on writing, and in which &lt;em>readers already have accounts&lt;/em> helps with growth. Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m sure there is a lot of fake accounts in there given that the typical &amp;ldquo;open count&amp;rdquo; for any article hovers around 50%, but that feels impressive regardless compared to what I was able to achieve in the past.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="evolution-monetization">Evolution: Monetization&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>And before parting, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the taboo topic, should we? Every hobby has to become a side hustle these days, right, but God forbid you try to charge for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have to confess that I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled with monetizing my writing and done some experiments. These included: &lt;a href="/2009/06/trying-adsense.html">enabling Google AdSense&lt;/a> back when I used Blogger and then &lt;a href="/2010/05/ads-gone.html">running away from it&lt;/a>; writing paid-for &lt;a href="/2019/10/onlamp-articles.html">articles for OnLamp&lt;/a>, which weren&amp;rsquo;t really part of this blog originally but were written in the same &amp;ldquo;spirit&amp;rdquo;; enabling optional paid subscriptions in Substack, which has generated a handful of leads; and using Amazon affiliate links for certain product-focused articles, which has also generated some sales.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None of these have generated any meaningful amount of income, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it isn&amp;rsquo;t exciting to see pennies flow in! In any case, I still struggle with the thought of pursuing monetization. It&amp;rsquo;d feel great to be paid for the effort I put in writing, but in the grand scheme of things, I would not be able to make it my primary income&amp;mdash;and I&amp;rsquo;d probably not want it to be either&amp;mdash;without putting in &lt;em>a ton more&lt;/em> effort. Plus I like my content to reach as far as possible, which paywalls would prevent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does that mean I will &lt;em>never&lt;/em> try to more aggressively monetize this type of content? Never say never, but I have no plans for now. That said, I will still gladly take and infinitely appreciate any donations you might send; don&amp;rsquo;t be shy!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="from-blogging-to-newslettering">From blogging to&amp;hellip; newslettering?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Why do I keep writing a blog after 20 years? Because I enjoy the &lt;em>process&lt;/em> and the reward of seeing a complete piece be appreciated by many. I know, &amp;ldquo;views&amp;rdquo; are a vanity metric, but they do translate into tangible real-world benefits. I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that I had the chance to land a Google internship in 2008 &lt;em>because&lt;/em> of what I wrote in my blog; I&amp;rsquo;m also pretty certain that my recent job changes have been aided by my writing; and during the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve met some folks I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen for a long time and several have exclaimed &amp;ldquo;hey, I enjoy your blog!&amp;rdquo; which, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, is flattering to hear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are blogs truly dead? The answer sounds like &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo;. But what if I asked you if newsletters are truly dead? The answer sounds like &amp;ldquo;of course not&amp;rdquo;, right? And, to me, these two look like essentially the same thing. Maybe the differences lie in the fact that blogs &lt;em>used to&lt;/em> be made of much shorter posts and used to be part of a larger community, whereas newsletters focus on longer pieces distributed primarily via email&amp;hellip; but considering how blogging itself has evolved for some (including me), the two are identical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which brings me to the final thought of the day: is &amp;ldquo;Blog System/5&amp;rdquo; the same as the &amp;ldquo;jmmv&amp;rsquo;s weblog&amp;rdquo; that launched 20 years ago? No, not really. They are quite different beasts at this point, but they still come from the same&amp;mdash;even if older&amp;mdash;person, they still scratch the same itch, and they are still my main window to showcase ideas and projects to the outside world. So, to me, they are indeed the same.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-06-22-livejournal-20041126.png" length="140932" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Porting the EndBASIC console to an LCD</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/04/endbasic-st7735s.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 13:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/04/endbasic-st7735s.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello again Blog System/5 and sorry for the radio silence for the last couple of months. I had been writing too much in here and neglecting my side projects so I &lt;em>needed&lt;/em> to get back to them. And now that I&amp;rsquo;ve made significant progress on cool new features for &lt;a href="https://www.endbasic.dev/">EndBASIC&lt;/a>, it&amp;rsquo;s time to write about them a little!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the defining characteristics of EndBASIC is its hybrid console: what looks like a simple text terminal at first glance can actually render overlapping graphics and text &lt;em>at the same time&lt;/em>. This is a feature that I believe is critical to simplify learning and it first appeared with &lt;a href="/2021/11/endbasic-0.8.html">the 0.8 release&lt;/a> back in 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-04-26-endbasic-hybrid-console.png" width="100%" />
&lt;figcaption>EndBASIC's hybrid console running in the web browser, rendering text and overlapping graphics at once, all controlled from the built-in command prompt.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>A few months before that, I had added support for simple GPIO manipulation in &lt;a href="/2021/02/endbasic-0.6.html">the 0.6 release&lt;/a> and, around that same time, I impulse-bought a tiny LCD for the Raspberry Pi with the hope of making the console work on it. But life happened and I lost momentum on the project&amp;hellip; until recently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll guide you through the process of porting the EndBASIC hybrid console to the ST7735s 1.44&amp;quot; LCD shown below, which sports a resolution of 128x128 pixels, a D-pad, and 3 other buttons. I will cover the prerequisite work to make the port possible, dig into the GPIO and SPI interface of an LCD, outline the design for a fast rendering engine, and conclude with pointers for you to build your own &amp;ldquo;developer kit&amp;rdquo;. Let&amp;rsquo;s go!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Even though I had plans to support graphics in the EndBASIC console from the very beginning, the first versions of the product did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> support graphics. That fact didn&amp;rsquo;t prevent me from defining a &lt;code>Console&lt;/code> abstraction anyway because I needed to support various operating systems and, more importantly, write &lt;a href="/2020/12/unit-testing-a-console-app.html">unit tests for the console&lt;/a>. Such abstraction was a straightforward trait representing text-only operations, like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Later on, when the time came to add graphics support, I extended the &lt;code>Console&lt;/code> trait with additional rendering primitives, like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="w"> &lt;/span>&lt;span class="c1">// ... and more graphics operations ...
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="c1">&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">}&lt;/span>&lt;span class="w">
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>What constitutes a primitive or not depends on the graphics device. In the snippet above, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy to understand why &lt;code>draw_pixel&lt;/code> exists. But why is &lt;code>draw_circle&lt;/code> there? SDL2, for example, does not provide a circle drawing primitive and forces you to implement your own algorithm on top of individual pixel plotting. However, the HTML &lt;code>canvas&lt;/code> element &lt;em>does&lt;/em> provide such a primitive and thus it is important to expose access to it for performance reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A reasonable design, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not quite. The problem is that mixing the textual and graphical operations under just one abstraction bundles two concepts together. Take, for example, the innocent-looking &lt;code>print&lt;/code> function: writing text to the console requires knowing the current cursor position, writing text at that location, wrapping long lines, and then updating the cursor position and moving its glyph. This sequence of operations is given to us &amp;ldquo;for free&amp;rdquo; when the &lt;code>Console&lt;/code> is backed by a terminal&amp;mdash;the kernel or terminal emulator handle all details&amp;mdash;but none of this exists when you stare at a blank graphical canvas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, the SDL2 and the HTML canvas console implementations had to supply their own code to represent a textual console on top of their backing graphical canvases. But due to tight timelines&amp;mdash;I wanted to release graphics support &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/641791002">in time for a conference&lt;/a>&amp;mdash;I ended up with &lt;em>a lot&lt;/em> of copy/pasted code between the two. Unfortunately, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just copy/pasted code. Oh no. It was copy/pasted code with minor variations throughout. For example: SDL2 coordinates are &lt;code>i32&lt;/code> whereas HTML canvas coordinates are &lt;code>float&lt;/code>s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This duplication with minor differences required unification before attempting to write a console driver for the LCD because I could not afford to introduce yet another duplicate of the same code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="past-netbsd-experience-to-the-rescue">Past NetBSD experience to the rescue&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The first step to resolving this conundrum was to unify the implementation of the two graphical consoles as much as possible. Having worked on &lt;a href="https://www.netbsd.org/docs/guide/en/chap-cons.html">NetBSD&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>wscons&lt;/code> console framework&lt;/a> eons ago, I knew how this had to be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea was to separate the text console manipulation from the underlying graphics primitives. As you can imagine, the way to do this was via a new abstraction, &lt;code>RasterOps&lt;/code>, providing direct access to the &amp;ldquo;raster operations&amp;rdquo; of the graphics device.

&lt;p>Having done this, I added a new &lt;code>GraphicsConsole&lt;/code> type that encapsulates the logic to implement a terminal backed by an arbitrary graphical display, and then relies on a specific implementation of the &lt;code>RasterOps&lt;/code> trait to do the screen manipulation:&lt;/p>

A side-effect was that these changes increased my confidence in the HTML canvas variant because most code was now unit-tested indirectly via the SDL2 implementation. Here is how the simplification looked like:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I was now ready to reuse the &lt;code>GraphicsConsole&lt;/code> to quickly provide a new backend on top of the LCD.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="playing-with-the-c-interface">Playing with the C interface&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>With the foundational abstractions in place, it was time to prove that my idea of rendering the EndBASIC console on the tiny LCD was &lt;del>feasible&lt;/del> cool enough to pursue. But I knew absolutely nothing about the LCD so, before diving right into the &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; implementation, I had to create a prototype to get used to its API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, I found an &amp;ldquo;SDK&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and I put it in quotes because SDK is quite an overstatement&amp;mdash;for the LCD somewhere online. The SDK consists of a pair of C and Python libraries that provide basic graphics drawing primitives, text rendering, and access to the D-pad and the buttons. This was a &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; finding because the code was simple enough to understand, functional enough to build a prototype, and allowed me to skip reading through the data sheet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I chose to do the easiest thing: I folded the C library into EndBASIC using Rust&amp;rsquo;s C FFI and quickly implemented a &lt;code>RasterOps&lt;/code> on it. With that, I could instantiate a &lt;code>GraphicsConsole&lt;/code> backed by the LCD and demonstrate, in just a couple of hours before the crack of dawn, that the idea was feasible. And it was more than feasible: it was super-exciting! Here, witness the very first results:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;video width="100%" controls>
&lt;source src="/images/2024-04-26-endbasic-st7735s-prototype.mov" type="video/mp4">
&lt;/video>
&lt;figcaption>First prototype of the EndBASIC console on the ST7735s LCD display, reusing the vendor-provided C library from Rust with lots of hacks.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>But performance was also awful. Using the C library was enough to show that this idea was cool and worth pursuing, but it was not the best path forward. On the one hand, the code in the C library was rather crappy and fragile to integrate into Rust via &lt;code>build.rs&lt;/code>; and, on the other hand, I needed precise control of the hardware primitives to achieve good rendering performance levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-lcd-hardware-interface">The LCD hardware interface&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Before diving into the solution, let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick peek at the hardware interface of the LCD. Note that this is just a very simplified picture of what the LCD offers and is derived from my reverse-engineering of the code in the SDK. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there is more to it, but I do not have the drive to go through the aforementioned data sheet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The LCD is a matrix of pixels where each position contains an integer representing the color of the pixel. The representation of each color value depends on the selected pixel format, but what the SDK uses by default is RGB565: a 16-bit value decomposed into two 5-bit quantities for red and blue and one 6-bit quantity for green.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is pretty standard stuff for a framebuffer-style device but the mechanism to write to the LCD is different. Unlike most framebuffer devices backed by video cards, the LCD matrix is not memory-mapped: we have to issue specific reads and writes via the GPIO and SPI busses. The GPIO bus is used to control hardware registers and the SPI bus is used to transfer large data sequences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simplifying, the LCD offers just two primitives. The first is a &amp;ldquo;set window&amp;rdquo; operation to define the window for rendering. This tells the LCD what rectangular region to update with new pixel values on the &lt;em>subsequent&lt;/em> &amp;ldquo;set data&amp;rdquo; operation. Executing this operation requires a GPIO write to select the operation followed by an SPI write to set the window position and dimensions.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-04-26-rpi-lcd-set-window.png" width="100%" />
&lt;figcaption>Representation of an LCD's "set window" operation.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The second is a &amp;ldquo;set data&amp;rdquo; primitive to set the contents of the previously-defined window. This primitive just sends a stream of pixel color values that will be written on the window, top-left to bottom-right. Executing this operation requires a GPIO write to select the operation followed by a &amp;ldquo;very large&amp;rdquo; SPI write to write the pixel data.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-04-26-rpi-lcd-set-data.png" width="100%" />
&lt;figcaption>Representation of an LCD's "set data" operation.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>By default, SPI writes on Linux are limited to 4KB in size and the full LCD content is 128x128 pixels * 2 bytes per pixel = 32KB, which means drawing the whole LCD requires 8 separate SPI writes. (It is possible to raise the default via a kernel setting, which I did too, but let&amp;rsquo;s ignore that for now.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Understanding that the LCD hardware interface is as simple and constrained as this is super-important to devise an efficient higher-level API, which is what we are going to do next.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="double-buffering">Double-buffering&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Having figured out the native interface, I faced two problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first one was performance. Issuing individual &amp;ldquo;set window&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;set data&amp;rdquo; commands works great to draw on large portions of the LCD, but sending these commands on a pixel basis as would be necessary to render letters or shapes like circles would be prohibitively slow.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;video width="100%" controls>
&lt;source src="/images/2024-04-26-endbasic-st7735s-demo-ffi.mov" type="video/mp4">
&lt;/video>
&lt;figcaption>An EndBASIC demo program bouncing a bunch of rectangles on the screen running with the prototype console driver that relied on the C library without double-buffering or damage tracking.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The second one was the inability to &lt;em>read&lt;/em> the contents of the LCD. Certain operations of the console, like moving the cursor or entering/exiting the builtin editor, require saving portions of the screen aside for later restoration. The LCD does not offer an interface to read what it currently displays. (Actually I don&amp;rsquo;t know because I did not read the data sheet&amp;hellip; but even if it does, the reads would involve slow SPI bus traffic which we should avoid.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To address these two problems, I decided to implement double-buffering for the LCD: the console driver reserves a portion of main memory to track the content of the LCD and all operations that update the LCD first write to this buffer. This allows the code to decide &lt;em>when&lt;/em> to send the buffer to the LCD, allowing it to compose complex patterns in memory&amp;mdash;e.g. plotting letters pixel by pixel&amp;mdash;before ever touching the GPIO and SPI busses. And this also allows trivially reading portions of the LCD.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-04-26-rpi-lcd-buffer-damage.png" width="100%" />
&lt;figcaption>Representation of the double-buffering and damage tracking techniques.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Which brings me to the next point. Part of this solution required adding damage tracking as well. Flushing the full in-memory buffer to the LCD is expensive&amp;mdash;remember, with the default SPI configuration, we need to issue 8 separate writes to flush 32KB of data&amp;mdash;and many times, like when moving the cursor around in the editor, this is not necessary. Therefore, it is important to keep track of the portion of the display that has been &amp;ldquo;damaged&amp;rdquo; by drawing operations and then only flush that portion of the buffer to the LCD. This maps perfectly well to the hardware primitives offered by the LCD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that in mind, and after a bit of iteration, I ended up splitting the implementation of the LCD &lt;code>RasterOps&lt;/code> into two pieces. One is the &lt;code>Lcd&lt;/code> trait, which exposes the basic &amp;ldquo;set window&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;set data&amp;rdquo; primitives of an LCD as a single &lt;code>set_data&lt;/code> operation:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The other is the &lt;code>BufferedLcd&lt;/code> type, which implements the general idea of buffering and damage tracking on top of a generic &lt;code>Lcd&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This design keeps all of the complex logic in one place and, as was the case with the &lt;code>Console&lt;/code> abstraction, allowed me to unit-test the tricky corner cases of the double-buffering and damage tracking by supplying a test-only &lt;code>Lcd&lt;/code> implementation. This was critical during development because I wrote most of this code while I was on a trip without access to the device, and when I came back home, the &amp;ldquo;real thing&amp;rdquo; worked on the first try.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Invest in Rust and exhaustive unit testing! They really are worth it to deliver working software quickly. But I digress&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="font-rendering">Font rendering&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The last interesting part of the puzzle was rendering text. You see: for the previous graphical consoles I wrote based on SDL2 and the HTML &lt;code>canvas&lt;/code> element, I was able to use &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/plex/">a nice TTF font&lt;/a>. But with the LCD&amp;hellip; well, the LCD has no builtin mechanism to render text and the very restrictive 128x128 resolution means that most fonts would render poorly at small sizes anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To solve this problem, I had to implement my own text rendering code, which sounds scary at first but isn&amp;rsquo;t as hard as it sounds. One issue was coming up with the font data, but the SDK for the LCD came with a free reusable 5x8 font that I took over. Another issue was coming up with a mechanism to efficiently render the letters because plotting them pixel by pixel on the LCD would be unfeasible, but this was solved by the previous buffering and damage tracking techniques.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having my own font rendering code is interesting. If you used a BASIC machine back in the 1980s, the computer-supplied manual would show you the glyphs used by the machine like this page demonstrates:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-04-26-amstrad-cpc-c7p9.png" width="100%" class="with-border"/>
&lt;figcaption>Page 9 of Chapter 7 of the Amstrad CPC 6128 user manual showing the glyphs corresponding to characters 32&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In some machines like the Amstrad CPC 6128, you could use the &lt;code>SYMBOL&lt;/code> command to define your own glyphs. And in some others, you could &lt;code>POKE&lt;/code> the memory locations where the glyphs were stored to (re)define them. So I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that&amp;hellip; maybe I should forget about the TTF font and instead expose a custom bitmap font in all EndBASIC consoles to allow for these neat tricks.&lt;/p>

&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Once you have those pieces, get either Raspbian or Ubuntu, flash the image to the microSD, and boot the machine. After that, you have to build and run EndBASIC from unreleased sources until I publish 0.11:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I know, I know, this is all quite convoluted. You have to manually go through the process of setting up Linux, then installing Rust, and then building EndBASIC from source. All of this is super-slow too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which means&amp;hellip; what I want to do next is to build a complete &amp;ldquo;Developer Kit&amp;rdquo;, including a lightweight prebuilt SD image that gives you access to EndBASIC out of the box in just a few seconds. Right now I&amp;rsquo;m playing with downsizing a NetBSD/evbarm build so that the machine can boot quickly and, once I have that ready, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to port EndBASIC&amp;rsquo;s hardware-specific features to work on it. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll postpone 0.11 until this is done, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interested in any of this? Please leave a note! And if you have tried the above at all with your own hardware, post your story too!&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-04-26-endbasic-st7735s-editor.jpg" length="2750893" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>How "new type" helps avoid production outages</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/03/new-type-and-production-outages.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2024 09:50:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/03/new-type-and-production-outages.html</guid><description>&lt;p>My &lt;a href="/2024/01/links-january-2024-edition.html">January links recap&lt;/a> included the &lt;a href="https://experimentalworks.net/posts/2024-01-22-simple-phantom-types/">&amp;ldquo;Phantom Types&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> article by David Soria Parra. In it, the author briefly touches upon the &amp;ldquo;new type&amp;rdquo; idiom, its typical implementation in Rust, and then proceeds to propose a better alternative. But the question arises: why should you care?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To answer why this idiom is useful, I want to present you with a real production problem we faced in the Storage Infrastructure team at Google circa 2010. That issue made me a convert and I&amp;rsquo;ve kept it in mind when designing APIs since then.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-is-new-type-anyway">What is &amp;ldquo;new type&amp;rdquo; anyway?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/behavioural/newtype.html">&amp;ldquo;new type&amp;rdquo; idiom&lt;/a> is a programming pattern whereby you define domain-specific types to wrap native types. Then, you use those types in your code and only &amp;ldquo;lower&amp;rdquo; them to their underlying types when passing the values to any external APIs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More specifically, your public interfaces&amp;mdash;but also private methods and functions&amp;mdash;should never receive primitive types like integers or strings. A function like &lt;code>allow_write(username: String, size: usize)&lt;/code> should not exist in your code base.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, what you&amp;rsquo;d do is define two new types, &lt;code>Username&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Size&lt;/code>, that wrap the string and integer values. These types are trivial wrappers over the native types (e.g. &lt;code>struct Username(String)&lt;/code> and &lt;code>struct Size(usize)&lt;/code>) with the goal of making them zero-cost abstractions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, as David&amp;rsquo;s article describes, this simplistic way to implement the pattern lends itself to code duplication for every type. And, as you know, code duplication leads to slight inconsistencies over time, which may increase maintenance costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this is not relevant now. &amp;ldquo;New type&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;new type&amp;rdquo; no matter how you implement it and no matter which language you choose. What I want to showcase here is &lt;em>why&lt;/em> adopting this pattern helps at all. And, for that, it&amp;rsquo;s time to dive into the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="quota-management-outage">Quota management outage&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Back in the early days of the Storage Infrastructure at Google, we the SRE team managed tens of shared file system deployments (aka &lt;em>cells&lt;/em>). Those file systems were multi-user and had support for quotas&amp;mdash;like pretty much any file system worthy of consideration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Storage quotas are typically expressed as two quantities: a &lt;em>bytes quota&lt;/em>, which says how much disk space a user can use; and a &lt;em>files quota&lt;/em>, which says how many files a user can store. Tracking byte usage limits disk usage and tracking file usage limits metadata overhead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, even with the replicated and zonal system that Google had, it was convenient to &lt;em>manage&lt;/em> user quotas in a centralized way. So that&amp;rsquo;s what we also had: the equivalent of a MySQL database tracking how much quota each user had allocated in which cell, world-wide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far so good. But how do you keep the decentralized storage cells decoupled from the quota database? Easy! Via a cron job that reads the quotas and pushes them to cluster-local &amp;ldquo;configuration&amp;rdquo; files so that each cell doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to know about the central database.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, this cron job is code. And code has bugs. So here is what happened: there was some function somewhere that looked like this: &lt;code>set_quota(user: String, bytes: usize, files: usize)&lt;/code>. And, for whatever reason, a caller invoked it as &lt;code>set_quota(user, files, bytes)&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notice the problem? The caller swapped the arguments but the language did not flag this issue and&amp;hellip; the tests didn&amp;rsquo;t catch it either! It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunately too common for people to write the same sentinel values (&lt;code>set_quota(&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;, 100, 100)&lt;/code>) for different test arguments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon after this change was checked in, the code rolled out to production and&amp;hellip; of course, the moment it touched the first canary deployment, things went south. Users started receiving out of quota alerts even when they should have had, in theory, plenty of available quota.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h1 id="the-aftermath">The aftermath&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The fix to the above was trivial: swap the arguments in the problematic caller and call it a day. But that&amp;rsquo;s a naïve fix. It just corrects the immediate problem but does not minimize the chances of it happening again. That is: this change is a &lt;em>mitigation&lt;/em>, not a &lt;em>fix&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In good SRE fashion, the team went a bit further to prevent this issue from ever recurring. They adopted the &amp;ldquo;new type&amp;rdquo; pattern, created two separate types&amp;mdash;&lt;code>BytesQuota&lt;/code> and &lt;code>FilesQuota&lt;/code>&amp;mdash;and plumbed them through the whole program. And note: Rust wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a thing in 2010.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, the team contributed an entry to the &lt;a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2007/01/introducing-testing-on-toilet.html">Testing on the Toilet blog&lt;/a>, describing the issue and how this same problem had &lt;em>just&lt;/em> bitten a major financial company and had made them lose millions of dollars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s the simple story of the day. Please adopt the new type pattern. Future-you will be happy that you did when the compiler or language interpreter yells at you about something that&amp;rsquo;s obviously wrong.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-03-09-new-types-store.jpg" length="552435" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: February 2024 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/02/links-february-2024-edition.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/02/links-february-2024-edition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi folks!

&lt;p>Last month, I gave you a detailed explanation of how DOS applications pulled &lt;a href="/2024/01/from-0-to-1-mb-in-dos.html">all sorts of tricks&lt;/a> to maximize the usage of the first MB of the 80286+ address space. In this one, I continue the exploration to see how some DOS apps (particularly games) broke free from those limitations and moved into external memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a richer discussion, you can see the coverage in &lt;a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/138541/beyond-the-1-mb-barrier-in-dos/">OSNews&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/02/09/breaking-through-the-1-mb-barrier-in-dos-with-unreal-mode-and-more/">Hackaday&lt;/a> among the other usual places. That said, it looks like I pretty much drained the pool of people interested in this topic: the discussions are pretty quiet on this second post and the number of subscribers to Blog System/5 got a bump, but a small one.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Good reflections on the technical decisions made at a start up and how they turned up after four years. We need more of these sorts of introspective posts: many times, people in tech make decisions, stick around for a year or two, and then leave for &lt;del>greener pastures&lt;/del> higher comp without witnessing the impact that their choices had long-term. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this play out repeatedly and&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m probably at fault too.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This Linux distribution sounds very appealing because it is very non-conformant&amp;mdash;no glibc, GCC nor systemd&amp;mdash;and leverages core system components from FreeBSD. A tweet from @unixterminal shows &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/unixterminal/status/1756782019663606070">how to set it up under WSL&lt;/a>, which means it&amp;rsquo;s super-easy to test-run it if you happen to be on Windows. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried yet, but if you have some time, there goes an idea.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a believer in automated and comprehensive testing. I often hear that you should &lt;em>not&lt;/em> write tests for short-lived projects or during quick initial growth&amp;mdash;and I think such advice is just plain wrong. Tests &lt;em>do&lt;/em> slow you down at the very beginning of a greenfield project, but they pay dividends after just two weeks of full-time coding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article describes how the creators of FoundationDB reached the same conclusion because they developed and leveraged a solid infrastructure to run their software in a reproducible manner. They, in turn, turned this idea into a product&amp;mdash;which means that the article is an ad, but it won&amp;rsquo;t feel like it. Promise.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>An interesting story in trying to open an old document from 1990 and render it in its original format. Contemporary tools like LibreOffice or Word are still able to open it, but they don&amp;rsquo;t load diagrams properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is why I &lt;a href="/2016/01/medium-experiment-wrapup.html">made the choice&lt;/a> a long time ago to avoid Blogger and Medium and, even if you are now reading this in Substack, why I still author the originals in Markdown and store them in a Git repository.&lt;/p>

&lt;em>By yours truly on February 14th, 2024&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following up on the earlier two articles describing how DOS apps managed memory and dealt with the limitations of real mode, I was finally able to write about how DJGPP achieves those goals &lt;em>and also&lt;/em> makes GNU programs run on DOS. If you picture DJGPP as the &amp;ldquo;WSL for DOS&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; you aren&amp;rsquo;t too far off. Mind you, the article will show you bash running on DOS, but the content is primarily about the internals on how DJ achieved such feat.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Big news everyone! Rust is finally able to replace C and C++ because, thanks to this little library, you can now implement memory vulnerabilities too! Don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on the new GLWTSPL license either, which you&amp;rsquo;ll have to assess for compatibility with your own before you can incorporate the code.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is not an article but a mere comment from Andreas showing how the &lt;a href="https://ladybird.dev/">Ladybird&lt;/a> browser, a from-scratch implementation of the web, can now load VSCode. Most of it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, but some does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason I find this interesting is that it shows how much a small group of motivated developers can achieve in a short amount of time. &amp;ldquo;Nobody&amp;rdquo; believed that it was possible to implement a modern web browser from scratch in this day and age&amp;hellip; and Ladybird is proving that wrong. Back in my time in the Bazel team, I always said that Bazel&amp;rsquo;s demise would be a motivated grad student with lots of free time creating a truly open and small build system written in a systems language. The reason I believe this is possible is because I almost had that going on years before Bazel even existed&amp;hellip; but I lacked the expertise to push it forward.

You obviously can be one, but there is some nuance in what &amp;ldquo;knowing&amp;rdquo; C is truly about. Here is my take on the matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me repeat this first: of course you can be a perfectly good programmer without knowing C. Knowing &lt;em>a language&lt;/em> doesn&amp;rsquo;t make or break a programmer, and there are great programmers out there that don&amp;rsquo;t touch C. &lt;em>However&lt;/em>, knowing C says something about your &lt;em>journey&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you know C well, it means you&amp;rsquo;ve dealt with pointers and managed memory by hand. It probably also means you know the difference between system calls and library calls. And it might also mean that you know about FFI. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at this trinity and why these are important.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>🧠 First, memory.&lt;/strong> When learning C, you must deal with pointers, &lt;code>malloc&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>free&lt;/code>, and you must learn how these are put to use. You also may learn how to debug a segfault and probably use tools like Valgrind to find memory errors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None of this is trivial. Saying that &amp;ldquo;a pointer is just a memory address; what&amp;rsquo;s difficult in that!?&amp;rdquo; misses the point (get it?). Knowing what a thing &lt;em>is&lt;/em> is really different from knowing how to &lt;em>use&lt;/em> that thing. I covered something similar back in &lt;a href="/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html">my post about Rust&amp;rsquo;s Into trait&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But more importantly, pointers and memory management are not a &amp;ldquo;C thing&amp;rdquo;. These concepts show up in pretty much &lt;em>any&lt;/em> language. For example, both Java and Python differentiate primitive types from objects&amp;hellip; and, guess what, object references are essentially pointers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without knowing pointers, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to reason about pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference semantics. Without knowing memory management, you can&amp;rsquo;t easily tell whether your code makes a reasonable use of memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>📣 Second, system calls vs. library functions.&lt;/strong> For example, how do &lt;code>read&lt;/code> and &lt;code>fread&lt;/code> differ? They are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> the same thing and using them interchangeably can lead to performance problems. Reading bytes one by one with &lt;code>read&lt;/code> is very inefficient but isn&amp;rsquo;t with &lt;code>fread&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When learning C, you often have to read manpages because they are the primary source of documentation for the C APIs. In doing so, you probably have noticed that certain manpages are in section 2 (system calls) and others are in section 3 (library functions).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every language must issue system calls but not all languages expose them as clearly as C does. The distinction exists in higher level languages but it is more subtle. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t careful, you can introduce performance problems like the one in &lt;a href="/2019/03/optimizing-tree-deletions.html">my post on deleting directory hierarchies&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>⚙️ Third, the Foreign Function Interface (FFI).&lt;/strong> Almost every language in your system has to end up calling into the C library to execute system calls. If you have learned C, you have probably also learned about stack frames and how a binary (ELF or whatnot) is put together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This knowledge is useful because, as I said, every language&amp;mdash;except for the stubborn Go&amp;mdash;has to talk to C for certain operations. And this interface &lt;a href="/2023/12/strings-encodings-nuls-and-bazel.html">isn&amp;rsquo;t always zero cost&lt;/a>. Knowing the costs helps write more efficient code.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>💡 So there they are. The three major topics that you are likely familiar with just by knowing C well. Of course you can be a good programmer without knowing these topics deeply, but being familiar with these will help you engineer better systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Paraphrasing Joel Spolksy&amp;rsquo;s article titled &lt;a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/12/29/the-perils-of-javaschools-2/">&amp;ldquo;The perils of JavaSchools&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> from 2005: there are only two types of programmers: those that know pointers (and recursion), and those that don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This aligns with my experience after interviewing 100+ candidates: there is a stark contrast between those that don&amp;rsquo;t known anything about memory management and those that do. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less about what language you choose, but I want to see if you know how things work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because, remember: these three topics have nothing to do with C per se: they are concepts that apply to almost any language. For example, you also deal with memory in Rust via &lt;code>Box&lt;/code>, but a &lt;code>Box&lt;/code> is is more opaque than explicit &lt;code>malloc&lt;/code> and &lt;code>free&lt;/code> calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So: don&amp;rsquo;t be worried if you don&amp;rsquo;t know C, but also don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to learn it! Just, please, don&amp;rsquo;t use it to start any new project. Keep C to yourself as a learning exercise, or leverage it as a tool to deal with legacy codebases.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-02-21-to-c-or-not-to-c.png" length="326255" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Running GNU on DOS with DJGPP</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/02/djgpp.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2024 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/02/djgpp.html</guid><description>&lt;p>The recent deep dive into &lt;a href="/2023/12/the-ides-we-had-30-years-ago.html">the IDEs of the DOS times 30 years ago&lt;/a> made me reminisce of DJGPP, a distribution of the GNU development tools for DOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember using DJGPP back in the 1990s before I had been exposed to Linux and feeling that it was a strange beast. Compared to the Microsoft C Compiler and Turbo C++, the tooling was bloated and alien to DOS, and the resulting binaries were huge. But DJGPP provided a complete development environment &lt;em>for free&lt;/em>, which I got from a monthly magazine, and I could even look at its source code if I wished. You can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what a big deal that was at the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But even if I could look under the cover, I never did. I never really understood why was DJGPP so strange, slow, and huge, or why it even existed. Until now. As I&amp;rsquo;m in the mood of looking back, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last couple of months figuring out what the foundations of this software were and how it actually worked. Part of this research has resulted in the previous two posts on DOS memory management. And part of this research is this article. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Special thanks go to DJ Delorie himself for reviewing a draft of this article. Make sure to &lt;a href="https://delorie.com/">visit his website&lt;/a> for DJGPP and a lot more cool stuff!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-is-djgpp">What is DJGPP?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Simply put, DJGPP is a port of the GNU development tools to DOS. You would think that this was an easy feat to achieve given that other compilers did exist for DOS. However&amp;hellip; you should know that Richard Stallman (RMS)&amp;mdash;the creator of GNU and GCC&amp;mdash;thought that GCC, a 32-bit compiler, was too big to run on a 16-bit operating system restricted to 1 MB of memory. DJ Delorie took this as a challenge in 1989 and, with all the contortions that we shall see below, made GCC and other tools like GDB and Emacs work on DOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To a DOS and Windows user, DJGPP was, and still is, an alien development environment: the tools&amp;rsquo; behavior is strange compared to other DOS compilers, and that&amp;rsquo;s primarily due to their Unix heritage. For example, as soon as you start using DJGPP, you realize that flags are prefixed by a dash instead of a slash, paths use forward slashes instead of backward slashes, and the files don&amp;rsquo;t ship in a flat directory structure like most other programs did. But hey, all the tools worked and, best of all, they were free!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, from reading about &lt;a href="https://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/eli-m17n99.html#Introduction">the historical goals of the project&lt;/a>, I gather that a secondary goal was for DJ to evangelize free software to as many people as possible, meeting them where they already were: PC users with a not-very-powerful machine that ran DOS. Mind you, this plan worked on some of us as we ended up moving to Linux and the free software movement later on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, being a free alien development environment doesn&amp;rsquo;t explain why it had to be huge and slow compared to other others. To explain this, we need to look at the &amp;ldquo;32-bit compiler&amp;rdquo; part.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="dos-and-hardware-constraints">DOS and hardware constraints&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As we saw in &lt;a href="/2024/01/from-0-to-1-mb-in-dos.html">a previous article&lt;/a>, Intel PCs based on the 80386 have two main modes of operation: real mode and protected mode. In real mode, the processor behaves like a fast 16-bit 8086, limiting programs to a 1 MB address space and with free reign to access memory and hardware peripherals. In protected mode, programs are 32-bit, have access to a 4 GB address space, and there are protection rules in place to access memory and hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DOS was a 16-bit operating system that ran in real mode. Applications that ran on DOS leveraged DOS&amp;rsquo; services for things like disk access, were limited to addressing 1 MB of memory, and had complete control of the computer. Contrary to that, GCC was a 32-bit program that had been designed to run on Unix (oops sorry, &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/about-gnu.html">GNU is Not Unix&lt;/a>) &lt;em>and&lt;/em> produce binaries for Unix, and Unix required virtual memory from the ground up to support multiprocessing. (I know that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/332699/how-the-original-unix-kernel-adressed-memory">not totally accurate&lt;/a> but it&amp;rsquo;s easier to think about it that way.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intel-native compilers for DOS, such as the Microsoft C compiler and Turbo C++, targeted the 8086&amp;rsquo;s weird segmented architecture and generated code accordingly. Those compilers had to deal with short, near, and far jumps&amp;mdash;which is to say I have extra research to do and write &lt;em>another&lt;/em> article on ancient DOS memory models. GCC, on the other hand, assumes the full address space is available to programs and generates code making such assumptions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>GCC was not &lt;em>only&lt;/em> a 32-bit program, though: it was also &lt;em>big&lt;/em>. In order to compile itself and other programs, GCC needed more physical memory than PCs had back then. This means that, in order to port GCC to DOS, GCC needed virtual memory. In turn, this means that GCC had to run in protected mode. Yet&amp;hellip; DOS is a real mode operating system, and calling into DOS services to access files and the like requires the processor to be in real mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To address this conundrum, DJ had to find a way to make GCC &lt;em>and the programs it compiles&lt;/em> integrate with DOS. After all, if you have a C program that opens a file and you compile said program with GCC, you want the program to open the file via the DOS file system for interoperability reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, witness this. The following silly program, &lt;code>headself.c&lt;/code>, goes out of its way to allocate a buffer above the 2 MB mark and then uses said buffer to read itself into it, printing the very first line of its source code:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yes, yes, I know the above code is really unsafe and lacks error handling throughout. But that&amp;rsquo;s not important here. Watch out what happens when we compile and run this program with DJGPP on DOS:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-02-14-headself.png"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Note two things. The first is that the program &lt;em>has to&lt;/em> have run in protected mode because it successfully allocated a buffer above the 1 MB mark and &lt;em>used&lt;/em> it without extraneous API calls. The second is that the program is invoking file operations, and those operations interact with files managed by DOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And here is where the &lt;em>really cool&lt;/em> stuff begins. On the one hand, we have DOS as a real mode operating system. On the other hand, we have programs that want to interoperate with DOS but they also want to take advantage of protected mode to leverage the larger address space and virtual memory. Unfortunately, protected mode cannot call DOS services because those require real mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The accepted solution to this issue is the use of a DOS Extender as we already saw &lt;a href="/2024/02/beyond-the-1-mb-barrier-in-dos.html">in the previous article&lt;/a> but such technology was in its infancy. DJ actually went through &lt;em>three&lt;/em> different iterations to fully resolve this problem in DJGPP:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The first prototype used Phar Lap&amp;rsquo;s DOS Extender but it didn&amp;rsquo;t get very far because it didn&amp;rsquo;t support virtual memory.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then, the first real version of DJGPP used DJ&amp;rsquo;s own DOS Extender called go32, a big hack that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about here.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And then, the second major version of DJGPP&amp;mdash;almost a full rewrite of the first one&amp;mdash;switched to using the DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>At this point, DJGPP was able to run inside existing DPMI hosts such as Windows or the many memory managers that already existed for DOS and it didn&amp;rsquo;t have to carry the hacks that previously existed in go32 (although the go32 code went on to live inside &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWSDPMI">&lt;code>CWSDPMI&lt;/code>&lt;/a>). The remainder of this article only talks about the latter of these versions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="large-buffers">Large buffers&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>One thing you may have noticed in the code of the &lt;code>headself.c&lt;/code> example above is that I&amp;rsquo;m using a buffer for the file read that&amp;rsquo;s 1 MB-long. That&amp;rsquo;s not unintentional: for such a large buffer to even exist (no matter our attempts to push it above 2 MBs), the buffer must be allocated in extended memory. But if it is allocated in extended memory, how can the file read operations that we send to DOS actually address such memory? After all, even if we used unreal mode, the DOS APIs wouldn&amp;rsquo;t understand it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer is the &lt;em>transfer buffer&lt;/em>. The transfer buffer is a small and static piece of memory that DJGPP-built programs allocate at startup time below the 1 MB mark. With that in mind, and taking a file read as an example, DJGPP&amp;rsquo;s C library does something akin to the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The protected-mode &lt;code>read&lt;/code> stub starts executing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The stub issues a DPMI read call (which is to say, it executes the DOS read file API but uses the DPMI trampoline) onto the transfer buffer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The DPMI host switches to real mode and calls the DOS read file API.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The real-mode DOS read places the data in the transfer buffer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The real-mode DPMI host switches back to protected mode and returns control to the protected-mode stub.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The protected-mode &lt;code>read&lt;/code> stub copies the data from the transfer buffer into the user-supplied buffer.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is all good and dandy but&amp;hellip; take a close look at &lt;a href="https://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-2783.htm">DOS&amp;rsquo;s file read API&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-plain" data-lang="plain">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Request:

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">BX -&amp;gt; file handle
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">CX -&amp;gt; number of bytes to read

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">AX -&amp;gt; number of bytes actually read (0 if at EOF before call)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">CF -&amp;gt; set on error
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">AX -&amp;gt; error code (05h,06h) (see #01680 at AH=59h/BX=0000h)
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s right: file read and write operations are restricted to 64 KB at a time because the number of bytes to process is specified in the 16-bit &lt;code>CX&lt;/code> register. Which means that, in order to perform large file operations, we need to go through the dance above multiple times in a loop. And that&amp;rsquo;s why DJGPP is slow: if the DPMI host has to switch to real mode and back for every system call, the overhead of each system call is significant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now is a good time to take a short break and &lt;a href="https://www.delorie.com/bin/cvsweb.cgi/djgpp/src/libc/dos/io/_read.c?rev=1.4">peek into DJGPP&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>read&lt;/code> implementation&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s succinct and clearly illustrates what I described just above. And with that done, let&amp;rsquo;s switch gears.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="globs-without-a-unix-shell">Globs without a Unix shell&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Leveraging protected mode and a large memory address space are just two important but small parts of the DJGPP puzzle. The other interesting pieces of DJGPP are those that make Unix programs run semi-seamlessly on DOS, and there are many such pieces. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover them all here because &lt;a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/eli-m17n99.html">Eli Zarateskii&amp;rsquo;s presentation&lt;/a> did an excellent job at that. So want I to do instead is look at a subset of them apart and show them in action.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To begin, let&amp;rsquo;s try to answer this question: how do you &lt;em>interact&lt;/em> with a program originally designed for Unix on a DOS system? The Unix shell is &lt;a href="/2020/11/cmdline-args-unix-vs-windows.html">a big part of such interaction&lt;/a> and &lt;code>COMMAND.COM&lt;/code> is no Unix shell. To summarize the linked article: the API to invoke an executable on Unix takes a list of arguments while on DOS and Windows it takes a flat string. Partially because of this, the Unix shell is responsible for expanding globs and dealing with quotation characters, while on DOS and Windows each program is responsible for tokenizing the command line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Leaving aside the fact that the DOS API is&amp;hellip; ehem&amp;hellip; bad, this fundamental difference means that any Unix program ported to DOS has a usability problem: you cannot use globs anymore when invoking it! Something as simple and common as &lt;code>gcc -o program.exe *.c&lt;/code> would just not work. So then&amp;hellip; how can we explain the following output from the &lt;a href="/src/djgpp/showargs.c">&lt;code>showargs.c&lt;/code>&lt;/a> program, a little piece of code that prints &lt;code>argv&lt;/code>?&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-02-14-showargs-glob-expansion-gcc.png"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In the picture above, you can see how I ran the &lt;tt>showargs.c&lt;/tt> program with &lt;tt>*.c&lt;/tt> as its own argument and somehow it worked as you would expect. But if we build it with a standard DOS compiler we get different results:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-02-14-showargs-glob-expansion-gcc-tcc.png"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>GCC is actually doing &lt;em>something&lt;/em> to make glob expansion work&amp;mdash;and it &lt;em>has&lt;/em> to, because remember that DJGPP was not just about porting GCC: it was about porting many more GNU developer tools to DOS. Having had to patch them one by one to work with DOS&amp;rsquo; &lt;code>COMMAND.COM&lt;/code> semantics would have been a sad state of affairs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To understand what&amp;rsquo;s happening here, know that all C programs compiled by &lt;em>any&lt;/em> compiler include a prelude: &lt;code>main&lt;/code> is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> the program&amp;rsquo;s true entry point. All compilers wrap &lt;code>main&lt;/code> with some code of their own to set up the process and the C library, and DJGPP is no different. Such code is often known as the &lt;code>crt&lt;/code> (or C Runtime) and it comes in two phases: &lt;code>crt0&lt;/code>, written in assembly for early bootstrapping, and &lt;code>crt1&lt;/code>, written in C.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can imagine, this is where the magic lives. DJGPP&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>crt1&lt;/code> is in charge of processing the flat command line that it receives from DOS and transforming it into the &lt;code>argv&lt;/code> that POSIX C programs expect, following common Unix semantics. In a way, this code performs the job of a Unix shell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once again, take a break to inspect the &lt;a href="https://www.delorie.com/bin/cvsweb.cgi/djgpp/src/libc/crt0/">&lt;code>crt0&lt;/code> sources&lt;/a> and, in particular, the contents of the &lt;a href="https://www.delorie.com/bin/cvsweb.cgi/djgpp/src/libc/crt0/c1args.c?rev=1.11">&lt;code>c1args.c&lt;/code> file&lt;/a>. Pay attention to file reads and the &amp;ldquo;proxy&amp;rdquo; thing, both of which bring us to the next section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="long-command-lines">Long command lines&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Unix command lines aren&amp;rsquo;t different just because of glob expansion. They are also different because they are usually &lt;em>long&lt;/em>, and they are long in part because of glob expansion and in part because Unix has supported long file names for much longer than DOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately&amp;hellip; DOS restricted command lines to a maximum of 126 characters&amp;mdash;fewer characters than you can fit in a Tweet or an SMS&amp;mdash;and this posed a problem because the build process of most GNU developer tools, if not all, required using long command lines. To resolve these issues, DJGPP provides two features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first is support for response files. Response files are text files that contain the full command line. These files are then passed to a process with the &lt;code>@file.txt&lt;/code> syntax, which then causes DJGPP&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>crt1&lt;/code> code to load the response files and construct the long command line in extended memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look. If we reuse our previous &lt;code>showargs.c&lt;/code> program that prints the command line arguments, we can observe how the behavior differs between building this program with a standard DOS compiler and with DJGPP:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-02-14-showargs-response-files-gcc-tcc.png"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Response files are easy to implement and they are sufficient to support long command lines: even if they require special handling on the caller side to write the arguments to disk and then place the response file as an argument, this could all be hidden inside the &lt;code>exec&lt;/code> family of system calls. Unfortunately, using response files is slow because, in order to invoke a program, you need to write the command line to a file&amp;mdash;only to load it immediately afterwards. And disk I/O used to be really slow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this reason, DJGPP provides a different mechanism to pass long command lines around, and this is via the transfer buffer described earlier. This mechanism involves putting the command line in the transfer buffer and telling the executed command where its command line lives. This mechanism obviously only works when executing a DJGPP program from another DJGPP program, because no matter what, process executions are still routed through DOS and thus are bound by DOS&amp;rsquo; 126 character limit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s try this too. For this experiment, we&amp;rsquo;ll play with two programs: one that prints the length of the received command line and another one that produces a long command line and executes the former.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first program is &lt;code>longcmd1.c&lt;/code> and is depicted below. All this program does is allocate a command line longer than DOS&amp;rsquo; maximum length of 126 characters and, once it has built the command line, invokes &lt;code>longcmd2.exe&lt;/code> with said long command line:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The second program is &lt;code>longcmd2.c&lt;/code> and is depicted below. This program prints the number of arguments it received and also computes the length of the command line (assuming all arguments were separated by just one space character):&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s see what happens when we compile these two programs with Turbo C++ and with DJGPP. First, let&amp;rsquo;s build both with Turbo C++ and run the &lt;code>longcmd1.exe&lt;/code> entry point:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-02-14-longcmd-both-tcc.png"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Running &lt;code>longcmd1.exe&lt;/code> fails because the command line is too long and &lt;code>execv&lt;/code> cannot process it. (I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure why &lt;code>execv&lt;/code> returns &lt;code>ENOMEM&lt;/code> because the Turbo C++ documentation claims that this function should return &lt;code>E2BIG&lt;/code> on this condition, but alas.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, let&amp;rsquo;s build &lt;em>just&lt;/em> &lt;code>longcmd1.c&lt;/code> with DJGPP and run it:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-02-14-longcmd-1gcc-2tcc.png"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>We get a bit further now! &lt;code>longcmd1.exe&lt;/code> runs successfully and executes &lt;code>longcmd2.exe&lt;/code>&amp;hellip; but &lt;code>longcmd2.exe&lt;/code> claims that the command line is shorter than we expect. This is because DJGPP&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>execv&lt;/code> implementation knew that it was running a standard DOS application &lt;em>not&lt;/em> built by DJGPP, so it had to place a truncated command line in the system call issued to DOS. (As a detail also note that this shows 141 and not 126: the reason for this is that DOS does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> place &lt;code>argv[0]&lt;/code> on the command line, but the C runtime has to synthesize this value.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But now look at what happens when we &lt;em>also&lt;/em> compile &lt;code>longcmd2.c&lt;/code> with DJGPP:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-02-14-longcmd-both-gcc.png"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Ta-da! When &lt;code>longcmd2.exe&lt;/code> runs, it now sees the full command line. This is because &lt;code>longcmd1.exe&lt;/code> now knows that &lt;code>longcmd2.exe&lt;/code> understands the transfer buffer arrangement and can send the command line to it this way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can read more about this in the &lt;a href="https://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/libc/libc_736.html">spawn documentation&lt;/a> from DJGPP&amp;rsquo;s libc and peek at the &lt;a href="https://www.delorie.com/bin/cvsweb.cgi/djgpp/src/libc/dos/process/dosexec.c?rev=1.29">&lt;code>dosexec.c&lt;/code> sources&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="unix-style-paths">Unix-style paths&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s move on to one more Unix-y thing that DJGPP has to deal with, which is paths and file names. You see, paths are paths in both DOS and Unix: a sequence of directory names (like &lt;code>/usr/bin/&lt;/code>) followed by an optional file name (like &lt;code>/usr/bin/gcc&lt;/code>). Unfortunately, DOS and Unix paths differ in two aspects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first is that DOS paths separate directory components with a backslash, not a forward slash. This is a historical artifact of the early CP/M and DOS days, where command-line flags used the forward slash (&lt;code>DIR /P&lt;/code>) instead of Unix&amp;rsquo;s dash (&lt;code>ls -l&lt;/code>). When DOS gained support for directories in its 2.0 release, it had to pick a different character to separate directories, and it picked the backslash. Dealing with this duality in DJGPP-built programs seems easy: just make DJGPP&amp;rsquo;s libc functions allow both and call it a day. And for the most part, this works&amp;mdash;and in fact even PowerShell does this on Windows today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second is that DOS paths may include an optional drive name such as &lt;code>C:&lt;/code> and&amp;hellip; the drive name has the colon character in it. While Unix uses the colon character to separate multiple components of the search &lt;code>PATH&lt;/code>, DOS could not do that: it had to pick a different character, and it picked the semicolon. Take a look:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-plain" data-lang="plain">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">C:\&amp;gt;path
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">PATH=Z:\;C:\DEVEL\BIN;C:\DEVEL\DJGPP\BIN;C:\DEVEL\TC\BIN
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The problem here is that many Unix applications, particularly shell scripts like &lt;code>configure&lt;/code>&amp;mdash;especially &lt;code>configure&lt;/code>&amp;mdash;read the value of the &lt;code>PATH&lt;/code> variable and split it at colon separators or append to it by adding a colon. But if we do these textual manipulations on a DOS-style &lt;code>PATH&lt;/code> like the one shown above&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;ll get the wrong behavior because of the drive names&amp;mdash;and Unix programs don&amp;rsquo;t know they have to split on the semicolon instead and we cannot be expected to fix them all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way DJGPP deals with this is by faking the &lt;code>/dev/&lt;/code> device tree. While DJGPP provides implementations of things like &lt;code>/dev/null&lt;/code>, it also exposes DOS drives via their corresponding &lt;code>/dev/[a-z]/&lt;/code> virtual &lt;em>directory&lt;/em>. So, if you wanted to run applications that parse or modify the &lt;code>PATH&lt;/code>, you could rewrite the above as this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-plain" data-lang="plain">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">PATH=/dev/z:/dev/c/devel/bin:/dev/c/devel/djgpp/bin:/dev/c/devel/tc/bin
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This would allow any application reading the &lt;code>PATH&lt;/code> to continue to work. But note that this value doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to leave the realm of the current process, which is interesting:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-02-14-bash-path.png"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The picture above shows how bash sees a DOS-style &lt;code>PATH&lt;/code> after it starts. Manually setting it to a Unix path keeps the Unix path in the current process (as shown by the built-in &lt;code>echo&lt;/code> calls), but when we spawn a different one (&lt;code>env&lt;/code> is a separate executable), the value is reset. This makes sense because, if we are running a regular DOS program from within a DJGPP one, we want to export a DOS-compatible environment. Which means the Unix variants probably only stick within shell scripts. You can also see how this works by peeking at &lt;a href="https://www.delorie.com/bin/cvsweb.cgi/djgpp/src/libc/dos/process/dosexec.c">&lt;code>dosexec.c&lt;/code>&lt;/a> again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But wait a minute&amp;hellip; did I just show you bash?! On DOS? Oh yes, yes I did&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="trying-it-out-yourself">Trying it out yourself&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s time to get our hands dirty, try this out, and reminisce the old days! Or, actually, not &lt;em>so&lt;/em> old. You should know that DJGPP is &lt;em>still&lt;/em> available in this day and age and that it is quite up to date with GCC 12.3&amp;mdash;released less than a year ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First off, start by installing DOSBox. You can use the &lt;a href="https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1">standard DOSBox version&lt;/a>, but it&amp;rsquo;s probably better to go the &lt;a href="https://dosbox-x.com/">DOSBox-X route&lt;/a> so that you can get Long File Name (LFN) support by setting the &lt;code>ver=7.1&lt;/code> configuration option. Otherwise, beware that running Bash later on will create &lt;code>.bash_history&lt;/code> under &lt;code>C:\&lt;/code> but the file will be named &lt;code>.BAS&lt;/code> due to some odd truncation, and this will later confuse Bash on a second start and assume that &lt;code>.BAS&lt;/code> is actually &lt;code>.bash_login&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, &lt;a href="https://www.delorie.com/djgpp/getting.html">pick a mirror&lt;/a> for your downloads. You&amp;rsquo;ll see various uses of FTP in the list but don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if clicking on those doesn&amp;rsquo;t work: major browsers have unfortunately dropped their FTP client so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to &amp;ldquo;fall back&amp;rdquo; to an HTTP mirror.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From there, you can use the &lt;a href="https://www.delorie.com/djgpp/zip-picker.html">Zip Picker&lt;/a> to help you choose what you need or you can download the same files I did:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2apps/csdpmi7b.zip&lt;/code>: The &lt;code>CWSDPMI&lt;/code> free DPMI host.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2apps/rhid15ab.zip&lt;/code>: The RHIDE &lt;a href="/2023/12/the-ides-we-had-30-years-ago.html">console IDE&lt;/a> akin to Turbo C++.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2/djdev205.zip&lt;/code>: Base DJGPP tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2gnu/bnu2351b.zip&lt;/code>: GNU Binutils (tools like &lt;code>gas&lt;/code> and &lt;code>objdump&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2gnu/bsh4253b.zip&lt;/code>: GNU Bash.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2gnu/em2802b.zip&lt;/code>: GNU Emacs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2gnu/fil41br3.zip&lt;/code>: GNU coreutils (tools like &lt;code>ls&lt;/code> and &lt;code>cp&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2gnu/gcc930b.zip&lt;/code>: GCC itself.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2gnu/gdb801b.zip&lt;/code>: GDB because why not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2gnu/gpp930b.zip&lt;/code>: G++.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2gnu/grep228b.zip&lt;/code>: grep because I find it very handy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2gnu/mak44b.zip&lt;/code>: GNU Make.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2gnu/shl2011br3.zip&lt;/code>: Various shell utilities (like &lt;code>basename&lt;/code> and &lt;code>dirname&lt;/code>) that you&amp;rsquo;ll almost-certainly need to run shell scripts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>v2gnu/txt20br3.zip&lt;/code>: GNU textutils (tools like &lt;code>cat&lt;/code> and &lt;code>cut&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Once you have those files, create the &amp;ldquo;root&amp;rdquo; directory for what will be the &lt;code>C:&lt;/code> drive in DOSBox. I keep this under &lt;code>~/dos/&lt;/code> and it is much easier to prepare this directory from &lt;em>outside&lt;/em> of DOSBox. Within that location, create a &lt;code>djgpp&lt;/code> subdirectory and unpack &lt;em>all&lt;/em> the zip files you downloaded into it. If there are any file conflicts, just tell unzip to overwrite them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the unpacking finishes, go to your DOSBox configuration. If you are on Windows, you should have a start menu entry called &amp;ldquo;DOSBox 0.74-3 Options&amp;rdquo; or similar which opens the configuration file in Notepad. If you are on Linux or any other reasonable OS, you can find the configuration file under &lt;code>~/.dosbox/&lt;/code>. In the configuration, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to set up the &lt;code>C:&lt;/code> drive at the very bottom of the file where the &lt;code>[autoexec]&lt;/code> section is. Here is what I do:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-plain" data-lang="plain">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">[autoexec]
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">MOUNT C C:\Users\jmmv\dos
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\DJGPP\BIN
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">SET DJGPP=C:\DJGPP\DJGPP.ENV
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">C:
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Launch DOSBox and you are set. Enter full-screen by pressing &lt;code>Alt+Enter&lt;/code> for the full retro experience and then&amp;hellip; launch &lt;code>bash&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I know I promised that this follow-up article would be about DJGPP, but before getting into &lt;em>that&lt;/em> review, I realized I had to take another detour to cover three more topics. Namely: &lt;em>unreal mode&lt;/em>, which I intentionally ignored to not derail the post; &lt;em>LOADALL&lt;/em>, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about until you readers mentioned it; and &lt;em>DOS extenders&lt;/em>, which I was planning to describe in the DJGPP article but they are a better fit for this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; strap your seat belts on and dive right in for another tour through the ancient techniques that DOS had to pull off to peek into the memory address space above the first MB. And get your hands ready because we&amp;rsquo;ll go over assembly code for a step-by-step jump into unreal mode.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="what-is-unreal-mode-anyway">What is unreal mode anyway?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Having read the preceding post, you should know by now what the real, protected, and VM86 modes of the x86 processors are. But there is one extra unofficial mode I did not talk about, and that is the &lt;em>unreal mode&lt;/em>. The mode with the coolest name if you ask me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unreal mode is a special state of the processor in which the CPU acts as if it was in real mode&amp;hellip; but with segment descriptors that allow it to reference memory above the 1 MB limit. These segments are impossible to define in real mode but, with different tricks for the 80286 and 80386, they become a possibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To understand how unreal mode works, we need to go back to the diagram I presented earlier describing the address resolution process that the 80286&amp;rsquo;s MMU executes on every memory access:&lt;/p>

&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-80286-mmu-access.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Diagram representing the operations that the 80286 does, in hardware, to resolve a &lt;tt>segment:address&lt;/tt> memory reference.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>As you can see in the diagram, for every memory access of the form &lt;code>segment:offset&lt;/code>, the MMU:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>decodes the segment selector specified by &lt;code>segment&lt;/code> to determine whether to query the GDT or LDT and which segment descriptor to read,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>reads the determined segment descriptor by indexing into the GDT or LDT tables,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>decodes the segments&amp;rsquo; base address and limit as stored in the descriptor,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>checks the privileges of the executing code against the protections recorded in the descriptor,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and ensures the &lt;code>offset&lt;/code> is within the segment limit defined in the descriptor.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Only after these steps complete successfully, the memory access is allowed; otherwise, the processor raises a General Protection Fault exception.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all conceptually good until you realize that the GDT and LDT live in main memory&amp;hellip; and main memory is slow&amp;mdash;&lt;em>excruciatingly&lt;/em> so in processor time. Having to read from main memory to resolve &lt;em>every&lt;/em> memory access, even with a good L1 or L2 cache, would have a big performance impact on most applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To resolve this inefficiency, the processor has a cache of segment descriptors. Instructions that update the segment registers, such as &lt;code>MOV DS, AX&lt;/code>, fetch descriptors from the GDT or LDT tables and store them in the cache. Instructions that reference memory, such as &lt;code>MOV AX, DS:1234h&lt;/code>, read the descriptors from the cache without ever reaching out to main memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-02-07-descriptor-cache.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Diagram representing how the instructions used to load a register like &lt;tt>DS&lt;/tt> are decoupled from the instructions that later consume the details about &lt;tt>DS&lt;/tt>. It is crucial to note how the segment descriptor cache completely shields the second instruction from accessing main memory to resolve the address.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>So far so good, but let&amp;rsquo;s add another twist. The diagram I presented earlier showing how the 80286 resolves a memory address does not only apply to protected mode: it applies to real mode too. In both modes, the processor accesses the descriptor cache to peek at the segment limits and protection settings. This means that, for real mode to work as 8086 code expects, the cache must contain values that are compatible with real mode: in particular, the limits must be set to 64 KB.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what if we could somehow load arbitrary segment descriptors into the processor&amp;rsquo;s cache and leverage those in real mode? If we could do that, we could increase the segment limits stored in the cache, and then any memory references that use those cached descriptors would be able to bypass the real mode rules and access extended memory directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And this, dear reader, is what unreal mode is about. There is a ton of nuance about how this mode was discovered and how it got its name, and to learn more about that story, I&amp;rsquo;ll redirect you to &lt;a href="https://www.os2museum.com/wp/a-brief-history-of-unreal-mode/">OS/2 Museum&amp;rsquo;s excellent history of the unreal mode&lt;/a>. But keep in mind that unreal mode is a clutch that DOS applications used to access memory above the 1 MB mark while avoiding expensive protected mode switches.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="leveraging-unreal-mode">Leveraging unreal mode&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Before describing how we can switch the processor to unreal mode, we must first look at how we can actually take advantage of this mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 80286 case, unreal mode is annoying to use: the 80286 is a 16-bit CPU, which means that the &lt;code>offset&lt;/code> part of a memory reference is limited to 64 KB. We can configure segments whose base address lies beyond the 1 MB address space, allowing us to read extended memory from real mode, but we can only do so in 64 KB chunks at a time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 80386 fares better due to it being a 32-bit CPU: the &lt;code>offset&lt;/code> part of a memory reference can be expressed as a 32-bit quantity. We can do both &lt;code>MOV AX, DS:[SI]&lt;/code> and &lt;code>MOV AX, DS:[ESI]&lt;/code>, which means that if &lt;code>DS&lt;/code> has a base of zero, we can reference any memory position in the 4 GB address space when using the &lt;code>ESI&lt;/code> offset. Crucially, and contrary to what some people think, we can issue these two variants from 16-bit real mode: 32-bit instructions are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> restricted to protected mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way the 80386 allows 32-bit instructions in 16-bit mode and vice versa is via two properties. The first is an instruction width setting at the code segment level: segment descriptors can indicate that the code they contain is 16-bit or 32-bit. The default for real mode is to assume that code segments are set to 16 bits, but in protected mode we can choose whatever we prefer. The second is the &lt;code>0x66&lt;/code> instruction prefix, which tells the processor that the following instruction operates in &lt;em>the opposite&lt;/em> mode of what is configured in the current code segment: e.g. if the current code segment is a 16-bit segment, the &lt;code>0x66&lt;/code> prefix marks 32-bit instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowing this, we can see that unreal mode is most useful in the 80386 because, once enabled, code can easily reference any extended memory address using 32-bit offsets and the &lt;code>0x66&lt;/code> prefix. But the 16-bit constraints of the 80286 don&amp;rsquo;t make unreal mode less useful given how much the DOS ecosystem needed to escape the real mode address space limitations and how difficult it was to leave protected mode in the 80286.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that out of the way, what we are missing in our discussion are the ways by which to enter unreal mode. There are at least two: the undocumented LOADALL instruction and an unsupported jump from protected mode to real mode. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at both.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="loadall">LOADALL&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>LOADALL is an undocumented instruction of the 80286 and 80386 processors. This instruction has a long history and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to cover it in detail because &lt;a href="https://rep-lodsb.mataroa.blog/blog/intel-286-secrets-ice-mode-and-f1-0f-04/">others have done a much better job than I could&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ll restrict my explanation to what the instruction does and why it is useful to enter unreal mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simply put, all LOADALL does is, as its name implies, set all processor registers at once with values that come from a memory region. This is similar to the widely unused built-in task switching functionality of x86 processors, which reloads the processor state with register values stored in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_state_segment">Task State Segment (TSS)&lt;/a> descriptor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But LOADALL has some quirks that the TSS descriptor doesn&amp;rsquo;t have, and those are what make it interesting. Witness the contents of the memory that LOADALL reads on an 80286:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">0860h-0865h TSS descriptor cache
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Registers, registers, more registers, descriptor cache&amp;hellip; Wait, what? Entries for the &lt;em>cached&lt;/em> segment descriptors? That&amp;rsquo;s interesting. These are the actual values for the segment descriptors that the processor stores in its internal cache. Which means that, by issuing a carefully-crafted LOADALL, we can tell the processor to set the cached descriptors to values that are nonsensical for the current operation mode&amp;mdash;and the processor does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> complain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In essence, with just one instruction, we can tell the processor that the cached descriptors have base addresses above the 1 MB limit and/or that they have limits larger than 64 KB. And the processor will just accept those into the cache and use them for future memory references.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As it turns out, &lt;a href="https://www.os2museum.com/wp/himem-sys-unreal-mode-and-loadall/">&lt;code>HIMEM.SYS&lt;/code> did leverage LOADALL&lt;/a> and we can even find its &lt;a href="https://github.com/neozeed/himem.sys-2.06">original source code&lt;/a> to peek into &lt;a href="https://github.com/neozeed/himem.sys-2.06/blob/main/oemsrc/xm286.asm#L241">how it achieved&lt;/a> this feat. It&amp;rsquo;s not trivial to do, but the performance gains of such an undocumented instruction were too hard to pass on in order to implement efficient transfers between conventional and extended memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This made me curious so I tried replicating LOADALL&amp;rsquo;s usage in &lt;a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox&lt;/a> and&amp;hellip; failed because DOSBox does not implement this instruction&amp;mdash;which is understandable because it was not documented, it was very specific to two processors, and it apparently was not widely used outside of &lt;code>HIMEM.SYS&lt;/code>. Maybe more-accurate processor emulators supply it, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother trying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which brings us to the other way to enter unreal mode: an unsupported jump from protected mode to real mode in the 80386.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="real-to-protected-mode-and-back">Real to protected mode and back&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Protected mode fascinated me as a child when I read about it in books that didn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;belong&amp;rdquo; to my age. After having dipped my toes in 8086 assembly and having toyed around with boot sectors and the like, I fantasized about how protected mode &amp;ldquo;unlocked&amp;rdquo; enormous power. I knew I had to learn such black arts to write my own operating system and I remember writing code that tried to enter protected mode and always failed&amp;mdash;yet it sounded so easy from the books: just set bit 0 of &lt;code>CR0&lt;/code> to 1!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-02-07-assembly-books.jpg" />
&lt;figcaption>The assembly and processor books I read once upon a time and that got me interested in all of this low-level systems programming.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until many years later, around 2007, that I decided I wanted to fulfill my long-term dream to write an operating system. At that point, I invested some time to get protected mode to work&amp;mdash;and I finally did, with interrupts enabled and all. (Spoiler alert: I never got to write an OS though&amp;hellip; yet?) But even if that worked, getting into protected mode is always a frustrating experience of having to get many teeny tiny details right just so that the machine doesn&amp;rsquo;t crash. You do it right and you see absolutely nothing; you do it wrong and you see absolutely nothing either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But wait. Why am I telling you all this? Ah yes, because another way of entering unreal mode is the following dance:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Switch to protected mode.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set up segment registers to segment descriptors that provide access to the full address space, causing the cached descriptors to have a 4 GB limit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Switch back to real mode with the previous unsupported segment configuration in place.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Upon switching back to real mode, the properties of the segment descriptors that don&amp;rsquo;t make sense in real mode (those limits higher than 64 KB) are &lt;em>sticky&lt;/em>, meaning that no architectural operations such as &lt;code>MOV DS, AX&lt;/code> touch those bits of the cache. With that, it becomes possible to address extended memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-02-07-real-mode-load.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Diagram representing how a real mode segment descriptor load does &lt;i>not&lt;/i> modify the limit or flags already stored in the descriptor cache.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, the 80286 did not have a mechanism to switch from protected mode back to real mode. Creative folks found ways to do this by triple-faulting the CPU and carefully setting registers to skip the BIOS POST code, but this process was extremely slow and thus unfeasible for frequent switches. At the time, the lack of this feature in the 80286 was a major complaint from OS vendors because it made it difficult to support running DOS programs from within a modern operating system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intel addressed those concerns with the launch of the 80386 and its new VM86 mode. But&amp;hellip; that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the only change. The 80386 also added the ability to return to real mode from protected mode&amp;mdash;with a lot of caveats. Intel was prescriptive in how exactly to return to real mode and never described what would happen if you didn&amp;rsquo;t follow the rules to the letter&amp;hellip; which was essentially begging for someone to try and see what would happen when doing that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer, as we saw above, is unreal mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="hands-on-unreal-mode">Hands-on unreal mode&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>All of the above research made me really curious so I got the urge to see unreal mode in action. So, in preparation for this article, I wrote a trivial DOS program that enters unreal mode and shows it working.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As in the past, getting this demo to a functional state was a frustrating experience of fighting with carefully-crafted register values and memory offsets, DOSBox crashes, and &lt;a href="https://bochs.sourceforge.io/">Bochs&lt;/a> oddities. But in the end my demo ran successfully, and because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any trivial, readily-available sample piece of code online that did this, I concluded that I &lt;em>had to&lt;/em> present it to you here for posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So. Let&amp;rsquo;s get our hands dirty. All you need is &lt;a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">&lt;del>Doom Emacs&lt;/del>&lt;/a> a text editor, &lt;a href="https://www.nasm.org/">NASM&lt;/a>, and DOSBox. Our goal is to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>write a flat COM executable,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>without sections (code and data mixed),&lt;/li>
&lt;li>all in 16-bit code with the occasional 32-bit operation override,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>that enters protected mode,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>that stores a string somewhere in extended memory far from the reach of real mode,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>that drops back to (un)real mode,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>that copies the string we stored in extended memory to conventional memory,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>that tells DOS to print the string we fetched,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and that finally returns to DOS to prove that DOS still works.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s begin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing we have to do is set up the GDT. We&amp;rsquo;ll use statically-configured descriptors in the code, like these:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="c1">;;; Null descriptor.

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The GDT presented above defines four descriptors:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The null descriptor, which is unused but must be present.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The code descriptor (&lt;code>CODE_DESC&lt;/code>) for our COM executable. This is configured to 16 bits so that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to mix 16-bit and 32-bit sections in the same source file (which is easy but I wanted to avoid). Note also that the base address is zero, but we&amp;rsquo;ll have to patch it up at runtime to point to the actual location where DOS loaded our executable. We cannot predict this and all the offsets built into the code must remain valid when in protected mode, so we must compute this dynamically.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The data and stack descriptor (&lt;code>DATA_DESC&lt;/code>) for our COM executable. For the same reasons as the code descriptor, we must compute its base address at runtime.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A linear data descriptor (&lt;code>LINEAR_DESC&lt;/code>) to be able to reference the whole 4 GB address space. We&amp;rsquo;ll use this one to set up the segments for unreal mode.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Next up, we need to define the descriptor for the GDT itself right after the GDT data section:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="nf">gdt_desc&lt;/span> &lt;span class="no">equ&lt;/span> &lt;span class="no">$-gdt&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="nf">gdt_base&lt;/span> &lt;span class="no">dd&lt;/span> &lt;span class="mi">0&lt;/span>
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Easy, but again, note how &lt;code>gdt_base&lt;/code> is zero. The address to the GDT needs to be a linear address, and because we don&amp;rsquo;t know where the COM file will be loaded, we have to compute this address at runtime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After this, it&amp;rsquo;s time to start the code section. The first thing we do is fix up all of the base addresses we left blank in the GDT itself and the GDT descriptor. Note that, because we target a COM binary (or a boot sector if you are so inclined), we can assume that &lt;code>CS&lt;/code>, &lt;code>DS&lt;/code>, &lt;code>ES&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>SS&lt;/code> all point to the same place, which makes things significantly easier:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> &lt;span class="c1">;; Assume CS = DS = ES = SS (COM file or boot sector).

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then, we do preparatory work to enter protected mode: namely, we disable the &lt;a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Non_Maskable_Interrupt">Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI)&lt;/a> and interrupts in general, and we enable the A20 gate:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> &lt;span class="c1">;; Disable the Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) and interrupts.

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And then, we can finally do the magic to enter protected mode by loading the GDT descriptor, updating the &lt;code>PE&lt;/code> (0th) bit in the &lt;code>CR0&lt;/code> register, and doing a long jump:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> &lt;span class="c1">;; Load the GDT.

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it. We have reached the protected mode realm! How exciting is &lt;em>that&lt;/em>? We are now in a 16-bit code segment but the machine state is mostly &amp;ldquo;unusable&amp;rdquo;. None of the segment registers except &lt;code>CS&lt;/code> are valid and interrupts are disabled (because we didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to set up the IDT&amp;mdash;and we don&amp;rsquo;t have to for this simple experiment). So let&amp;rsquo;s do the minimum set up that we need:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">&lt;span class="nl">protected_mode:&lt;/span>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now that the basic segments are configured, let&amp;rsquo;s copy the &lt;code>msg&lt;/code> string built into the binary into extended memory. We do this by pointing &lt;code>ES&lt;/code> to our linear segment and using the &lt;code>EXTENDED_ADDR&lt;/code> offset, which I set to an arbitrary 4 MB:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> &lt;span class="c1">;; Store a message in extended memory. We are in protected mode so this

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>But, crucially, we keep the A20 enabled in order to correctly reference extended memory later on!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And after all of this dance, that&amp;rsquo;s really it. We are in unreal mode. Any memory references we make through the &lt;code>FS&lt;/code> segment register can use offsets beyond the 1 MB limit no matter what its segment base is and no matter if the segment base &lt;em>changes&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Easy to say, hard to believe. Let&amp;rsquo;s prove that this is true. Let&amp;rsquo;s first fetch the message we stored in extended memory by copying it to conventional memory:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> &lt;span class="c1">;; Fetch the message from extended memory by using a large offset. This

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And now that we got it copied, let&amp;rsquo;s call into DOS to print the message and return control to DOS:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> &lt;span class="c1">;; Print the message we fetched from extended mode.

&lt;p>But, wait, there is more! If you happen to be running this under Bochs&amp;mdash;and I recommend that you do because it offers much better debugging facilities than DOSBox&amp;mdash;you can pause the simulation with &lt;code>CTRL+C&lt;/code> and dump the segment registers with &lt;code>sreg&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Pay attention to the details for the &lt;code>limit&lt;/code> field of all the segment registers. You can see how the value is &lt;code>0x0000ffff&lt;/code> for all of them as you&amp;rsquo;d expect in real mode&amp;hellip; but &lt;code>FS&lt;/code>&amp;rsquo;s limit is the non-standard &lt;code>0xffffffff&lt;/code>. We did it. We are in unreal mode and DOS still runs fine. (In fact, remember that &lt;code>HIMEM.SYS&lt;/code> itself &lt;em>does&lt;/em> leverage unreal mode and this driver was active almost all the time in a DOS installation.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IMPORTANT: You can download the full source code by clicking on &lt;a href="/src/unreal-mode/unreal.asm">&lt;code>unreal.asm&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you download the source code, you can build it with:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">nasm -o unreal.com unreal.asm
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And once built, you can run it within DOSBox by copying the binary into a directory you mount within the emulator or use &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/">mtools&lt;/a> to copy it into a DOS boot disk image for Bochs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="dos-extenders">DOS extenders&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you resisted the urge to keep toying with the example code presented above and are still reading, great! We can continue onto our final topic: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_extender">DOS extenders&lt;/a>. These programs are what truly set DOS free from the 1 MB address space limitations and thus are the right way to conclude this article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A DOS extender, in rough terms, is a wrapper for your code that enters protected mode and transfers control back to you. This is very useful because, by running in protected mode, your &lt;em>code&lt;/em> segment can span more than 640 KB, finally letting you run large binaries without resorting to ancient spells like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_(programming)">overlays&lt;/a>. But if that was the only thing that a DOS extender did, it would be too simple of a thing and not make it a DOS-anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-02-07-dos-extender.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Representation of the structure of a DOS-extended application and how it relates to a DOS extender, DOS drivers, and raw hardware access.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The crucial feature that DOS extenders provide is a mechanism to call &lt;em>back&lt;/em> into the BIOS and DOS to access the services these provide. In particular, this means accessing &lt;em>drivers&lt;/em> and &lt;em>the file system&lt;/em>. They do so by exposing the same &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_API">DOS API&lt;/a> of the real mode host in protected mode, and they do this so that they can transparently service it in an efficient manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The general mechanics behind DOS extenders are very similar to what I described earlier: they enter protected mode to use extended memory and run your code, but they &lt;em>temporarily&lt;/em> return to real mode to issue BIOS and DOS service calls. Unfortunately, this naive implementation would be quite inefficient, so DOS extenders actually service various APIs in protected mode to avoid returning to real mode, and they optimize large buffer transfers to minimize the number of switches when they &lt;em>do&lt;/em> have to switch modes. In other words, DOS extenders are their own mini OS on top of DOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DOS extenders were widely used in games, and you may well remember the iconic message that DOOM printed on startup:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-plain" data-lang="plain">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">C:\&amp;gt;DOOM
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">DOS/4GW Protected Mode Run-time Version 1.97
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">Copyright (c) Rational Systems, Inc. 1990-1994
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>These messages came from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS/4G">DOS/4G&lt;/a>, the most common DOS extender of all. The reason it was so common is because the &amp;ldquo;W version&amp;rdquo; was the free (but limited) edition of DOS/4G, and it shipped with the popular &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcom_C/C%2B%2B">Watcom&lt;/a> C compiler that produced protected mode binaries. But pay attention to &amp;ldquo;run-time&amp;rdquo; in that message. Why run-time?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DOS extenders were not the only system component that entered protected mode. By the time DOS extenders became popular, Windows was already a thing and Windows likes protected mode too. And as we saw in the previous post, DOS itself came with &lt;code>EMM386.EXE&lt;/code>, another mini hypervisor that put DOS inside a VM86 instance so that it could easily reference extended memory. So what if you wanted to run a popular DOS-extended program, say DOOM, inside one of these also-popular protected mode environments?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tough luck. Nesting protected modes was impossible until &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization">virtualization appeared&lt;/a>. VM86 was close to what was necessary but it didn&amp;rsquo;t allow running protected mode programs from within it. So, how did this work? How could you run a DOS-extended program inside Windows or while &lt;code>EMM386.EXE&lt;/code> was running?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like in any computing problem, the answer is simple: by means of an abstraction layer! To support this flow, Microsoft defined the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_Protected_Mode_Interface">DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI)&lt;/a>, an API to abstract the core services to interact with protected mode. DPMI is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> a replacement for a DOS extender though: DPMI is an API that DOS extenders themselves use to deal with protected mode operations.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-02-07-dpmi.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Simple representation of the role that DPMI plays in DOS-extended applications and different host operating systems.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In the case of DOS-extended programs, the first thing that they do at startup is check if a DPMI kernel is present. If one exists, such as when the DOS program runs within Windows, then the DOS extender leverages Windows&amp;rsquo; DPMI services and delegates all operations to Windows. But if such a provider isn&amp;rsquo;t running, the DOS extender starts the DPMI kernel typically built into itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to see even more code in action, I refer you to skim through the sources of the free &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dos32a/">DOS/32&lt;/a> extender and the free &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWSDPMI">CWSDPMI&lt;/a> host.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And with that, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that the next article will finally be the one talking about DJGPP and everything else it had to do to make Unix applications run semi-seamlessly on DOS&amp;hellip; unless some other preparatory essay becomes necessary!&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-02-07-80386-dos.jpg" length="152971" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: January 2024 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/01/links-january-2024-edition.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/01/links-january-2024-edition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>It is hard to believe but we are already one month into 2024.

&lt;em>By @luciascarlet on January 2nd, 2024&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This little Twitter rant aligns well with my own views of Windows: I have come to &lt;em>like&lt;/em> Windows 10 and 11 as you can see from my previous &lt;a href="/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html">lengthy review of the OS&lt;/a> and my &lt;a href="/2023/11/windows-nt-peeking-into-the-cradle.html">review of its history book&lt;/a>, and I &lt;em>do&lt;/em> think there are very interesting technical feats within this system. However, I do &lt;em>not&lt;/em> like where the platform is headed with the constant &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification&lt;/a> due to the increased coupling with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s own cloud services and the recent AI push.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same applies to macOS by the way: the problems aren&amp;rsquo;t as pronounced as on Windows, but its progressive iOSification removes freedoms in you can use your own machine. These issues combined have actually pushed me back into the Linux desktop&amp;hellip; and it&amp;rsquo;s a relief to not see a constant stream of attention-grabbing notifications and ads, and to have regained full control of my machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://fqa.9front.org/fqa0.html">&amp;ldquo;Introduction to Plan 9 &amp;ldquo;&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;br/>
&lt;em>By the 9front project&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plan 9 is an interesting creature. It&amp;rsquo;s the OS that should have succeeded Unix but never did: it was a little too different a little too late. This document provides an explanation of what Plan 9 is, why it never &amp;ldquo;evolved&amp;rdquo;, and why you should (not) use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But do you want to see something cool? Parts of Plan 9 are still with us &lt;em>today&lt;/em>. If you happen to be on a Windows desktop running WSL 2, go type this right now and behold:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">$ ps ax | grep [p]lan9

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s right. WSL leverages the Plan 9 file server to let Windows access files within the WSL 2 virtual machine. Oh wait, is this an idea for a future Blog System/5 article? You bet!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>System calls are sometimes oddly named&amp;mdash;like the well-known mistake of dropping the &lt;code>e&lt;/code> from the &lt;code>creat&lt;/code> syscall. But why is the naming of &lt;code>fstat&lt;/code>/&lt;code>lstat&lt;/code> not consistent with &lt;code>fseek&lt;/code>/&lt;code>lseek&lt;/code>? Read on for an interesting history review to reveal the answer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Generating random numbers on deterministic machines&amp;mdash;like computers are&amp;mdash;is an interesting problem. While it is possible to come up with a good random number generator, most &lt;code>rand&lt;/code>-like functions in most languages use a pseudo random number generator. What this means is that the numbers they produce is deterministic given a specific seed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, the author explains how they used this deficiency to break the communication barrier between the sandbox that World of Warcraft uses to run untrusted code and the user-provided add-ons that run under said sandbox. There is &amp;ldquo;some math&amp;rdquo; in there, but you can skip over it and still understand the basis of this sandbox exploit.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Knowing the mechanics of virtual memory is a necessity for any systems engineer. Knowing the internals of paging, however, is optional but still a very useful piece of knowledge to carry around. This article equips you with that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Myself, I knew how 32-bit paging worked but never bothered to learn how it did in 64-bit x86 chips. The fact is that there are some important differences because the approach that works for a 32-bit address space just doesn&amp;rsquo;t with a 64-bit address space: the page tables would take way too much memory!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, read this article for more details. I found the text somewhat hard to read, but it&amp;rsquo;s full of diagrams and detailed information so it&amp;rsquo;s worth a glance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Slices are partial views into an existing array: instead of performing a costly copy of a part of the array into a smaller array, you represent the &amp;ldquo;slice&amp;rdquo; as an address of a first element and a length specifying how many elements follow. Slices are traditionally represented as a &amp;ldquo;start pointer + count&amp;rdquo; pair but there are other representations possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, the question is: how do you represent empty slices? There are different choices, and different languages pick differently. This post dives into how C, C++, and Rust represent slices, and how Rust&amp;rsquo;s choices make it impossible to pass those slices to C and C++ without runtime checks and conversions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Last month I wrote a pretty successful article reminiscing the IDEs we had in the DOS days 30 years ago, and that article made me want to play with and write about DJGPP. However, while writing that &lt;em>other&lt;/em> draft, I realized I needed to clarify some concepts first for my own knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those concepts were around how DOS managed memory back in the day and what all the EMS, XMS, HMA and other acronyms meant. I spent various hours researching the topic and then wrote a summary describing the many ways DOS programs squeezed the most of the first megabyte of the address space. By the way, I discovered &lt;a href="https://www.draw.io/">draw.io&lt;/a> along the way and I regret not having tried it much before; it&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I am a fan of leveraging the type system to narrowly model the different concepts in a problem domain. Passing around integers or strings that mean different things as raw types has caused serious production outages in the past, and in my software I like to prevent against those. Traditionally I&amp;rsquo;ve used &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html">Rust&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;new type&amp;rdquo; idiom&lt;/a>, but this article presents a neat trick that seems easier to maintain than that one. If anything, it helps keep all of your types consistent with each other from an API perspective.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Deciding &lt;em>where&lt;/em> to publish content is something I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled (and I&amp;rsquo;m still struggling) with. No matter the medium, there is a trade off between convenience, familiarity and/or personal preference vs. audience. For example, while I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying my move to Substack from a self-hosted blog because of the sustained subscriber growth, I&amp;rsquo;m also well-aware that some of my past readers may not like this. Or as another example, whenever I have posted a Twitter thread, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to go through great lengths to &lt;em>also&lt;/em> post the same content here to avoid it being slurped into &amp;ldquo;thread reader&amp;rdquo; apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article does a nice job at diving into why people may be choosing certain publishing mediums and why it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to please everyone. I still don&amp;rsquo;t like the trend to move to video though.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This article is a deep dive on how DOS had to pull out tricks to maximize the use of the very limited 1 MB address space of the 8086.

&lt;h1 id="the-8086-and-real-mode">The 8086 and real mode&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Back in the 1980s, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8086">Intel 8086&lt;/a> was &lt;em>the&lt;/em> processor for PCs (along with its crippled sibling 8088 which I&amp;rsquo;ll ignore throughout this post). The 8086 was a simple chip with significant limitations, but it was incredibly successful and is the foundation of the x86 architecture that we still use today. Because the 8086 powered PCs, and DOS was the operating system that IBM chose for the PC, DOS was designed to work for the 8086.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the purposes of our article, let&amp;rsquo;s focus on two details: the 8086 CPU had a 20-bit address bus, which means it could only address 1 MB of memory, and it was a 16-bit CPU, which means that its internal registers were all 16-bit long. Which begs the question: if registers could only represent &lt;code>2^16 = 64K&lt;/code> different values, how could code reference a 20-bit address space?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer is &lt;em>segmentation&lt;/em>. In the 8086, every instruction that references memory does so by specifying an address as two separate 16-bit quantities: a &lt;em>segment&lt;/em> and an &lt;em>offset&lt;/em> within the segment. Because segments are 16-bit long, there can be up to 64KB segments&amp;mdash;and if we take the 1 MB total address space and divide it by 64KB, we deduce that segments are offset from each other by 16 bytes.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-8086-segments.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Representation of the way segmentation slices the 8086 1 MB address space into 64KB overlapping segments offset by 16 bytes from each other.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>There are two things of note in the diagram. First, segments overlap, meaning that a single memory location can be referenced by many different segment/offset combinations. And, second, all segments after &lt;code>0xF000&lt;/code> reference memory positions above the 1 MB address space that don&amp;rsquo;t exist, which the 8086 chose to wrap around by ignoring the 21st bit of an address. After all, there is no 21st line in the address bus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When accessing a piece of memory with an address of the form &lt;code>segment:offset&lt;/code>, say &lt;code>81DA:72C3&lt;/code>, the 8086 multiplies &lt;code>0x81DA&lt;/code> by 16 (a simple 4-bit shift to the left) and adds the &lt;code>0x72C3&lt;/code> offset to the result to obtain address &lt;code>0x89063&lt;/code>. From there on, the 8086 reads from or writes to that memory location and calls it a day. There is no &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit">Memory Management Unit (MMU)&lt;/a>: every memory access can reference any address, and all accesses are legal (including those that wrap around!) which means null or dangling pointer dereferences don&amp;rsquo;t cause any sort of crash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This type of MMU-less segmented addressing is known as &lt;em>real mode&lt;/em>, but this name didn&amp;rsquo;t appear until the 80286 had to give it a name to distinguish it from &lt;em>protected mode&lt;/em>. But before introducing the latter, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about memory maps for a second.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="conventional-and-upper-memory">Conventional and upper memory&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Just because the 8086 processor can reference 1 MB of memory does not mean that 8086 machines came equipped with 1 full MB of RAM. Machines typically included &lt;em>less&lt;/em> than that for cost reasons, so it&amp;rsquo;s critical to understand that the &lt;em>address space&lt;/em>&amp;mdash;that is, the set of addresses that can be &lt;em>referenced&lt;/em>&amp;mdash;is different from the amount of memory installed. No surprise there: the same is true today of modern 64-bit CPUs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This fact was advantageous because certain system devices prefer to expose themselves as part of the address space. For example: the BIOS ROM is accessible via a range of addresses in upper memory. Or another example: video cards tend to expose their framebuffer as a memory-mapped device so that applications can directly write to well-known addresses to manipulate video memory&amp;mdash;bypassing the separate I/O bus and instruction set.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The question is: where do such devices live within the address space? The choice is pretty much arbitrary, so what IBM did was split the &lt;a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Memory_Map_(x86)">address space of the original PC&lt;/a> in two parts. The first 640 KB, known as &lt;em>conventional memory&lt;/em>, were mapped to available RAM and were readily usable by applications. The upper 384 KB, known as &lt;em>upper memory&lt;/em> or the &lt;em>Upper Memory Area (UMA)&lt;/em>, were reserved for memory-mapped devices. This assignment of &lt;em>meaning&lt;/em> to portions of the address space for specific purposes is what&amp;rsquo;s called a &lt;em>memory map&lt;/em>, and this was the memory map of the original PC.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-8086-memory-map.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Representation of the 8086 PC memory map. Solid blocks correspond to mapped memory and dashed parts correspond to unmapped memory.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Note how conventional memory may not be fully usable: as shocking as it may sound today, PCs could have even less than 640 KB of installed RAM. More importantly for our purposes, the upper memory is &lt;em>sparse&lt;/em>: certain address ranges are assigned to devices, but there may be gaps between devices. What happens when reading from or writing to unmapped addresses is hard to tell as this depends on the chipset&amp;mdash;not the CPU&amp;mdash;but remember that all accesses had to be valid in some form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And by the way, there is one teeny tiny exception to the &amp;ldquo;all first 640 KB are free to use to applications&amp;rdquo;: the very first 1 KB of RAM is reserved for the Interrupt Vector Table, which is what the 8086 uses to look for interrupt handlers when it receives an interrupt, and a few more bytes after that are used by the BIOS to map volatile data. We can ignore these.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="expanded-memory-specification-ems">Expanded Memory Specification (EMS)&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As you can imagine, 640 KB of RAM were soon &lt;em>not&lt;/em> enough for many programs. Applications needed access to more memory, but the limitations of the 8086 20-bit address bus made it difficult. Yet there was a need for an immediate solution. The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_memory">Expanded Memory Specification (EMS)&lt;/a> was one of those first solutions and was originally designed by Lotus in order to support their star application &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3">1-2-3&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea is simple. Remember how upper memory is &lt;em>sparse&lt;/em>? What if we could map a window in that address space to a different portion of memory? And what if we could control, via software, which portion of memory was exposed through such window at any given time?&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-8086-ems.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Representation of the 8086 PC memory map and an EMS window in upper memory mapped to a portion of memory provided by an external ISA card.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This is precisely what EMS did. EMS brought the idea of having a software API that allowed applications to select views into &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; memory by mapping a 64 KB window in upper memory to another memory chip. Originally, this other memory was supplied by expansion ISA cards like the one below, which means that EMS required hardware support and hardware-specific drivers to perform the window remappings. This also means, by the way, that this memory could be much slower than standard RAM.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-emulex-persyst-4mb-isa.jpg" />
&lt;figcaption>An Emulex Persyst ISA card providing 4 MB of additional memory. It's notable how huge this was. Photo taken from the Wikipedia; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:EmulexPersyst_4M_ISA.jpeg">see original&lt;/a>.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>As you can imagine, this trick offered the theoretical ability to access &lt;em>any&lt;/em> amount of extra RAM on a machine&amp;hellip; at the expense of having to structure your application so that it explicitly (re)configured the window. Implementing such applications is difficult and is also insufficient when applications need a larger address space to function comfortably. EMS was a useful kludge, but still a kludge.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-80286-and-protected-mode">The 80286 and protected mode&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As the needs of programs and operating systems grew, processors themselves needed to grow more advanced features as well. In particular, they needed to gain the ability to access much more than just 1 MB of memory, and they needed to offer memory protection features to isolate programs from each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 80286, still a 16-bit CPU, grew the address space to 24 bits to support up to 16 MB of RAM. It introduced a MMU to offer memory isolation. But there was a problem here: the 8086 memory addressing mode of 16-bit &lt;code>segment:offset&lt;/code> pairs did not permit addressing memory beyond the first 1 MB. Thus the 80286 had to find a different way to reference the RAM beyond 1 MB, also known as &lt;em>extended memory&lt;/em>, and it did so by introducing a completely different operation mode known as &lt;em>protected mode&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once in protected mode, all memory access rules change. For one, the MMU takes charge of all memory accesses, ensuring that they are valid according to predefined protections. For another, the &lt;code>segment:offset&lt;/code> addresses change their semantics. The segment portion of an address stops being a scaled down memory address, and instead becomes an &lt;em>index&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Global_Descriptor_Table">into a table&lt;/a> (the GDT or LDT) of segment descriptors. Each segment descriptor describes the base address of a segment as a 32-bit quantity, the size of the segment as a 20-bit quantity, the access protections of the segment, and a bunch of flags.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-80286-mmu-access.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Diagram representing the operations that the 80286 does, in hardware, to resolve a &lt;tt>segment:address&lt;/tt> memory reference.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Under this model, instead of having an address like &lt;code>81DA:72C3&lt;/code>, we might see &lt;code>13:72C3&lt;/code>. To access this address, the MMU looks up entry 13 in the GDT, finds a descriptor that says that the segment starts at address &lt;code>0x81DA&lt;/code> and that it is &lt;code>0x7200&lt;/code> bytes long, and concludes that the &lt;code>13:72C3&lt;/code> reference is out of bounds, raising a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_protection_fault">General Protection Fault&lt;/a> hardware exception (your dreaded &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault">&amp;ldquo;Segmentation fault&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> error these days).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this access model is really different from what DOS applications were used to in real mode, and DOS itself was only designed to run in real mode. So DOS and all of its ecosystem were stuck in the real mode world, limited to addressing just 1 MB of memory without the ability to access extended memory&amp;hellip; or were they?&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-high-memory-area-hma">The High Memory Area (HMA)&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Avid readers might have noticed in a previous picture that, in real mode, there are a few segments that could, in theory, allow access to addresses above the 1 MB mark. Take &lt;code>FFFF:0010&lt;/code>, which is &lt;code>0xFFFF * 0x10 + 0x10 = 0x100000 = 2^20&lt;/code> or 1 followed by 20 zeroes in binary form. This is the first address into extended memory. The 8086 was able to produce such addresses, but they would wrap around because the 8086 had no way to issue the 21st bit to the memory bus.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For compatibility reasons, the 80286 had to truncate these addresses in real mode, and it did so by wiring the 21st line of the address bus (the A20) to zero. But what if the addresses &lt;em>didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> wrap around? What if we told the 80286 to &lt;em>not&lt;/em> truncate them? This can, in fact, be done by enabling the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A20_line#A20_gate">A20 gate&lt;/a>&amp;mdash;a task achieved via the keyboard controller, mind you. Enabling the A20 is a prerequisite for entering protected mode, but if done in real mode, it becomes possible to access an extra 64 KB of memory. This extra memory is known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_memory_area">High Memory Area (HMA)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-80286-hma.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Representation of the way segmentation slices the 80286 real mode 1 MB address space into 64KB overlapping segments offset by 16 bytes from each other, and how the last few segments can be made to spill into extended memory.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The HMA isn&amp;rsquo;t big by any means, but conventional memory was so limited that any tricks to gain extra memory were welcome and DOS did precisely that. By loading the &lt;code>HIMEM.SYS&lt;/code> driver and by specifying &lt;code>DOS=HIGH&lt;/code> in the &lt;code>CONFIG.SYS&lt;/code> file, DOS would relocate parts of itself into the HMA to free up to 64 KB of conventional memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, 64 KB of extra memory really aren&amp;rsquo;t that much. This is a nice trick, but applications really needed access to more memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="extended-memory-specification-xms">eXtended Memory Specification (XMS)&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Another technique to access extended memory (the memory visible beyond the first 1 MB) came in the form of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_memory#Extended_Memory_Specification_(XMS)">eXtended Memory Specification (XMS)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea of XMS is to provide an API that real mode applications can use to allocate chunks of extended memory and to copy data from/to those chunks via explicit calls. This is different from EMS because we aren&amp;rsquo;t talking about a fixed window of the address space referencing some external memory: we are talking about an API that is able to allocate arbitrary chunks of memory and return references to them, much like &lt;code>malloc&lt;/code> and &lt;code>free&lt;/code> do. Applications then use extra APIs to copy memory from/to those extended memory chunks into conventional memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;figcaption>Representation of the 80286 memory map with a block of extended memory copied into conventional memory by means of XMS.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>To implement the &lt;a href="http://www.phatcode.net/res/219/files/xms30.txt">XMS API&lt;/a>, a driver such as &lt;code>HIMEM.SYS&lt;/code> uses protected mode to manipulate the extended memory blocks, but the real mode applications never have to. Because XMS requires protected mode, this feature is only available in the 80286 and above processors, whereas EMS could be used by the 8086 with the right hardware assistance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much like EMS, XMS provided the theoretical ability to access an unlimited amount of extended memory from real mode at the expense of having to manually transfer small pieces of it into the limited 1 MB address space. This is not a trivial difficulty and is why even modern architectures like the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(processor)">Cell processor&lt;/a> and its &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(processor)#Synergistic_Processing_Elements_(SPE)">SPEs&lt;/a> with a separate and limited address space didn&amp;rsquo;t succeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far so good, but&amp;hellip; we can still squeeze some extra memory out of the real mode segmented address space. In particular, we still have some gaps in upper memory that we haven&amp;rsquo;t put to use.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To make further improvements possible, we need the additional processor features that came with the 80386. Compared to the 80286, the 80386 was a 32-bit processor capable of addressing up to 4 GB of RAM. More interesting for our discussion, however, were the addition of pagination&amp;mdash;which is the foundation of any modern operating system&amp;mdash;and a new execution mode known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_8086_mode">&lt;em>Virtual 8086&lt;/em>&lt;/a> or VM86 for short.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VM86 was originally envisioned to fix a major deficiency in the 80286: that is, the ability to run &lt;em>multiple&lt;/em> concurrent real mode applications from within a protected mode operating system because that&amp;rsquo;s what Windows and OS/2 wanted to provide. In today&amp;rsquo;s terms, VM86 acts as virtual machine hypervisor, providing the processor with a mechanism to enter a mode that behaves like real mode but that is backed by the protected mode MMU. All memory accesses are subject to translation via pagination and all privileged operations trap into protected mode, meaning that a hypervisor process can place VM86 tasks anywhere in the 4 GB memory address space and can context-switch between them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what if our hypervisor only spawned a single VM86 task to run DOS in? What if, then, the hypervisor leveraged the MMU to relocate portions of the real mode address space into portions of extended memory? That way, we could emulate EMS without dedicated hardware, providing applications a trivial way to peek into extended memory via 64 KB windows, or we could play other tricks&amp;hellip; like UMBs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="upper-memory-blocks-umbs">Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs)&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Remember the sparse upper memory area? Those 384 KB of memory wired to hardware devices but with gaps in them? What if we could take those gaps in upper memory and map them to some extended memory so that they were directly addressable from real mode? This is precisely what &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_memory_area">Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs)&lt;/a> are: portions of the upper memory area remapped to extended memory by means of VM86, transparently offering access to more memory from real mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an example, think about the video memory mappings in the original PC specification. The memory map reserved two chunks of the address space for video: one for monochrome displays and one for color displays. But only one of them can be in use at any given time. So whichever video mode is selected leaves the address space of the other mode unused, and thus such address space can be leveraged by the system as an UMB into which to load drivers or place user data.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-80386-umb.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Representation of the 80386 VM86 memory map with two UMBs in upper memory mapped to extended memory by means of the MMU and its pagination features.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In DOS, the &lt;code>EMM386.EXE&lt;/code> driver is in charge of providing UMBs. In principle, the chipset could also implement them in older processors, but the 80386 made this all possible in software by entering VM86 and then leveraging pagination to map pages of extended memory in the upper memory area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When UMBs are available, DOS offered ways to move load drivers and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminate-and-stay-resident_program">TSR programs&lt;/a> into UMBs by specifying &lt;code>DOS=UMB&lt;/code> in the &lt;code>CONFIG.SYS&lt;/code> file and then using the &lt;code>DEVICEHIGH&lt;/code> and &lt;code>LOADHIGH&lt;/code> commands.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In summary, we have seen four different techniques that evolved over time to squeeze the most memory out of the incredibly limited 1 MB address space of the 8086. These limitations haunted the PC ecosystem until Windows took over and it can be argued that Windows &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rdquo; because it made it much easier to take advantage of the larger address space of the 80386. Until that happened, however, users had to live with the EMS, XMS, HMA, and UMB mess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And a mess it was, and it was so pervasive that it leaked to users. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the output of the &lt;code>MEM&lt;/code> command, which was a very common utility to run when trying to maximize free conventional memory. In one of its simplest forms, &lt;code>MEM /C&lt;/code>, the command shows a summary of the memory usage per program and whether they are loaded in conventional or upper memory:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-mem-c-1.png" />
&lt;figcaption>First page of the output of the &lt;tt>MEM /C /P&lt;/tt> command.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;code>MEM /D&lt;/code>, which I did not know about back in the day, is more interesting. I have to show you its output as three separate images due to console size limitations:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-mem-d-1.png" />
&lt;figcaption>First page of the output of the &lt;tt>MEM /D /P&lt;/tt> command.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;figure>

&lt;figcaption>Second page of the output of the &lt;tt>MEM /D /P&lt;/tt> command.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-mem-d-3.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Third page of the output of the &lt;tt>MEM /D /P&lt;/tt> command.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&lt;code>MEM /D&lt;/code> shows us the memory map of the machine along with details about the location of each program. We can also see mentions of the conventional vs. upper address space, whether the HMA is in use, and consumption of XMS memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But in all of these outputs, we see that upper memory is not in use &lt;em>at all&lt;/em>. Why is that? Well, because MS-DOS out of the box doesn&amp;rsquo;t attempt to load drivers into it. For that, we have to manually modify &lt;code>CONFIG.SYS&lt;/code> and &lt;code>AUTOEXEC.BAT&lt;/code> with special commands and reorder entries to maximize the usage of the upper memory and the HMA. A black art.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which brings me to MemMaker, a tool that debuted with MS-DOS 6. This tool attempted to automatically reconfigure all drivers and TSRs loaded during boot so that the largest/majority of them fit in upper memory, leaving as much conventional memory free for application usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-memmaker-intro.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Welcome page to the MemMaker utility.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>As automated as it was, however, I&amp;rsquo;d say that MemMaker was an experts-only tool. Take a look at its advanced configuration options page, which I had to fiddle with to make the tool work in a KVM virtual machine running MS-DOS 6.22. You really need to understand the intricate details of real mode memory management to know what each of these options is about.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-memmaker-options.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Advanced options in the MemMaker utility.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>But if you made MemMaker run successfully, it would then greet you with a pretty cool page after a reboot. This page showed a breakdown of the changes made by MemMaker and how it was able to reclaim conventional memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2024-01-17-memmaker-results.png" />
&lt;figcaption>Final report of the changes made by the MemMaker utility.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>After that, we can look at the changes that MemMaker applied to the &lt;code>CONFIG.SYS&lt;/code> and &lt;code>AUTOEXEC.BAT&lt;/code> files. I never truly understood what all of these magic numbers meant, but now that I went through the hassle of researching and writing this article, I finally do. Just 30 years after I regularly used MemMaker to be able to play games in my multimedia 80386.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s it for today folks. I intentionally did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> touch on DPMI&amp;mdash;the technology that truly allowed DOS applications to break free from the 1 MB memory limitation&amp;mdash;because I&amp;rsquo;m saving that for the next article.

&lt;p>For context to everyone new around here, what follows is my manual curation of cool articles, videos, and projects I stumbled upon during this time period. But this is not &lt;em>just&lt;/em> a dump of links: &lt;em>each link is accompanied by a short commentary&lt;/em> that justifies why I thought the material was interesting, why it is relevant to this publication and, more importantly, an attempt to nudge you into reading it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>December has been a slow month though. During the first half, only a handful of articles caught my attention; and during the second half, I&amp;rsquo;ve been traveling so I haven&amp;rsquo;t paid much attention to news sites. In any case, there is some good content to enjoy this month. Read on and have a good entry to 2024!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Do you know how Wayland works, how it differs from X.org, and how it has some architectural limitations that prevent it from solving some problems that X11 does not have? If not, this one is for you. This article is from 2022 but recently surfaced as a timely rant because Fedora is planning to drop X.org in the upcoming Fedora 40 release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things will be&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; for some of us soon. In my case, I use Fedora 39 and Wayland recently decided to stop working on my Mac Pro 2013 and fell back to X.org. And on my Surface Go 2, on which I need to use &amp;ldquo;bounce keys&amp;rdquo; to prevent repeated input due to some issues with the keyboard, the feature only works with X.org and not Wayland.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I came across a random tweet that suggested newcomers to C to represent strings as an array plus a length, without the traditional NUL terminator.

&lt;p>Here is a thing from 1995 that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know existed: a BSD Unix distribution that ran on Windows 3.x. I wonder why this didn&amp;rsquo;t catch on but the likes of Cygwin did. By the way, this post made me remember &lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">DJGPP&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>, a distribution of GCC for DOS, and it&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;m considering to analyze and write about in an upcoming article.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While looking at yet another unexplained performance inefficiency that I observed, I wondered how many of these slip through because the machines we have today are &amp;ldquo;so powerful and quiet&amp;rdquo; that they absorb such abuse of resources without making a big fuss. I wrote a Twitter thread that explains how useful it was to have flashing LEDs for disk activity and loud fans during heavy CPU load, with a suggestion on what to do these days instead on your silent laptops.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Doom Emacs is my go-to editor. This Emacs &amp;ldquo;distribution&amp;rdquo; is great because its configuration files are trivial to read and edit, but I still feel a bit uncomfortable due to the many abstractions in between those files and the &amp;ldquo;real Emacs&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;particularly when Doom Emacs greets me with &amp;ldquo;loaded 200 packages&amp;rdquo; that I know little about. In that regard, this article series seems promising and I might go back to configuring a minimal setup at some point. (The second part is already out at the time of this writing, by the way.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>BASIC has received a lot of hatred throughout the years, with Dijkstra claiming &amp;ldquo;It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration.&amp;rdquo; Which, OK, fine. I can see that happening if you look at the original Dartmouth BASIC from the 1970s&amp;hellip; but later editions of BASIC included proper flow control to make these criticisms unfounded. Much more on this topic in the referenced article.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My Christmas gift to you all: a tour of the text-based IDEs we had about 30 years ago in DOS land to show how powerful and tiny they were at the time.

Back then, I did not fully comprehend what I was doing and why the tools I used were impressive given the constraints of the hardware we had. Having gained more knowledge throughout the years, it is now really fun to pick up DOSBox to re-experience those programs and compare them with our current state of affairs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, I want to look at the pure text-based IDEs that we had in that era before Windows eclipsed the PC industry. I want to do this because those IDEs had little to envy from the IDEs of today&amp;mdash;yet it feels as if we went through a dark era where we lost most of those features for years and they are only resurfacing now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If anything, stay for a nostalgic ride back in time and a little rant on &amp;ldquo;bloat&amp;rdquo;. But, more importantly, read on to gain perspective on what existed before so that you can evaluate future feature launches more critically.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="first-editors-and-tuis">First editors and TUIs&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In the 1990s, almost every DOS program you ran had a full-screen Text User Interface (TUI) which sported text-based windows, drop shadows, colors, and mouse support. Here is just one example:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2023-12-25-edit-com-colors.png" class="with-border">
&lt;figcaption>The MS-DOS Editor (aka &lt;tt>EDIT.COM&lt;/tt>) with one of its settings dialog open. Note the menu bar, the rich dialog with list selectors and buttons, and the status bar documenting navigation shortcuts.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Each program was its own island because its interface was unique to the program. However, they were all so similar in how they looked like&amp;mdash;80x25 characters didn&amp;rsquo;t leave much room for uniqueness&amp;mdash;and how they worked that the differences didn&amp;rsquo;t really get in the way of usability and discoverability. Once you learned that the Alt key opened the menus and that Tab moved across input fields and buttons, you could navigate almost any program with ease.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But let&amp;rsquo;s talk about editors. MS-DOS shipped with a TUI text editor since version 5 (1991), which &lt;a href="/2023/12/a-cli-text-editor-in-my-windows.html">I previously covered in a recent article&lt;/a> and is shown above. This editor &amp;ldquo;worked&amp;rdquo;, but it was really inconvenient for coding: you needed to exit the editor to compile and run your code, and when you re-ran the editor, you&amp;rsquo;d have to navigate back to where you were before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;In my house&amp;rdquo;, we used something called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_Sidekick">SideKick Plus&lt;/a> (1984), which wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a code editor: it was more of a Personal Information Management (PIM) system with a built-in notepad. The cool thing about it, however, was that it was a Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program, which meant that it loaded in the background and you could bring it up at any time by pressing Ctrl+Alt.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2023-12-25-sidekick-plus.png" class="with-border">
&lt;figcaption>SideKick Plus' main screen after pressing Ctrl+Alt to bring it up. Note how DOS remains in the background.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Think of this TSR feature as rudimentary multitasking for an OS that did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> have multitasking. This was really effective because quickly switching between code editing and building is critical for an efficient inner development loop. (And by the way, this past experience explains the design of the &lt;a href="https://www.endbasic.dev/docs.html#intro-first">code editing flow in EndBASIC&lt;/a>. I did not implement the equivalent of Ctrl+Alt, but I&amp;rsquo;ve considered it many times.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By this point, however, real IDEs had already existed for a few years. Turbo Pascal 1.0 (1983) shows the beginning of an integrated experience, although it did not feature its iconic TUI yet. QuickBASIC 2.0 (1986) shows more of a &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; TUI (the same as &lt;code>EDIT.COM&lt;/code>, because they are the same editor), and MS-DOS 5 came with QBasic, a reduced version of QuickBASIC that didn&amp;rsquo;t allow compiling to native code but that had the same look.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-borland-turbo-series">The Borland Turbo series&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The crown jewel of IDEs, in my opinion, were the later Borland Turbo series, which included Turbo C++ (1990), Turbo Assembler and Turbo Pascal. These IDEs were language specific, but they had full-screen TUIs and were extremely powerful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, take a look at what we had. Syntax highlighting:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Compiler integration and diagnostics:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Integrated project and build system management:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>A debugger with breakpoints, stack traces, and the like:&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>Borland Turbo C++ showing its integrated help system, with the "Hello World" program in the background and the help for &lt;tt>printf&lt;/tt>.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Remember: all of this in the early 1990s&amp;mdash;a little over 30 years ago at the time of this writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was an avid user of Turbo C++, with which I learned a lot. I remember using their &lt;code>conio.h&lt;/code> libraries to implement TUIs of my own, and then their builtin &lt;code>graphics.h&lt;/code> libraries to play with implementing GUIs. And note: this was &lt;em>without the Internet&lt;/em>. There was no option for many to just &amp;ldquo;look up how things worked&amp;rdquo; in Stack Overflow: the IDE had to be discoverable right away (which it was) and self-contained to offer you a complete development experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="what-about-linux-back-then">What about Linux back then?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Now take a moment to compare this scene with Linux in the early 1990s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Linux, almost every program was &lt;em>also&lt;/em> text based, but those programs did not come with a full-screen TUI. It just wasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;the Unix way&amp;rdquo;. I remember watching the X11 configuration tool (&lt;a href="https://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/QuickStart3.html">&lt;code>XF86Setup&lt;/code>&lt;/a>) or the OpenBSD installer and feeling shocked by how simplistic those were: me, a young teenager with barely any &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; coding experience, had written better-looking programs already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, this didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from my quest to &lt;em>not&lt;/em> use Windows. I continued to learn the ways of Linux and soon faced the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; editors recommended by every book and community online: Vim and Emacs. And I could not understand why they were praised. Using these was like stepping back into the past. They were full-screen programs indeed, but they seemed pretty arcane. Vim did have syntax highlighting but it was far from being an IDE. Emacs could be configured to integrate with some code assisting features and the like, but it was far from being &amp;ldquo;fire and forget&amp;rdquo; like the Turbo family of IDEs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just look at the default Emacs configuration &lt;em>today&lt;/em>, which hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed much (if at all) since then. It does have windows, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t decorated. It didn&amp;rsquo;t have colors (and now barely has), because why? It didn&amp;rsquo;t use to have mouse support. It &lt;em>does&lt;/em> have a menu bar though, but it is just a gimmick? If you press &lt;tt>M-`&lt;/tt> as the instructions tell you, you face a truly strange interface to navigate the menu&amp;mdash;which makes one wonder why they even bothered to waste a full line of screen real state to show a menu bar that does nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2023-12-25-emacs-menubar.png" class="with-border">
&lt;figcaption>A fresh installation of Emacs in the console, with the standard welcome screen in the background and the "menu" open after pressing &lt;tt>M-`&lt;/tt>.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Now try giving this to anyone with little coding experience and getting them to create, compile, and debug a program. They will have trouble just navigating the editor, and they won&amp;rsquo;t find any of the features that would allow for project management or compiler integration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For comparison, in writing this post, I fired up Turbo C++ in DOSBox and I was able to create a &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; project and navigate the environment in minutes&amp;mdash;all without prior knowledge (everything I had known has been forgotten by now). The environment is intuitive and, as an IDE, integrated all around.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="contemporary-tui-ides">Contemporary TUI IDEs&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Anyhow. Let&amp;rsquo;s forget about the past and look at what we have today in TUI-land. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to look at GUIs because&amp;hellip; well, Visual Basic was the pinnacle of graphics programming and we don&amp;rsquo;t have that either anymore&amp;mdash;which is also a topic for another day. (Well, OK, you have &lt;a href="https://gambas.sourceforge.net/">Gambas&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; but who knows about it?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The closest more-modern equivalent to the Borland Turbo C++ environment is &lt;a href="https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/RHIDE">RHIDE&lt;/a>. As you can see in the picture below, it looks incredibly similar&amp;mdash;and you&amp;rsquo;d be forgiven if you thought this &lt;em>is&lt;/em> Turbo C++. Unfortunately, it is DOS-only and seems to be mostly abandoned by now with its latest release dated 7 years ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2023-12-25-rhide.png" class="with-border">
&lt;figcaption>The RHIDE IDE showing the same "hello world" program as before, with no errors nor warnings after compilation.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Then we have &lt;a href="https://www.freepascal.org/">Free Pascal&lt;/a>. This is the closest you&amp;rsquo;ll get to the old experience but with a modern codebase, running natively on Unix systems and leveraging terminals of any size.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2023-12-25-free-pascal.png" class="with-border">
&lt;figcaption>The Free Pascal IDE with a trivial "hello world" program and overlapping windows for a built-in ASCII table and a calculator.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>And lastly we have &lt;a href="https://qb64.com/">QB64&lt;/a>. This closely resembles Microsoft QuickBasic but&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t let it trick you: even though it looks like a TUI, it is actually a GUI application that simulates a TUI. You cannot run QB64 in a terminal.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2023-12-25-qb64.png" class="with-border">
&lt;figcaption>The QB64 IDE, which looks textual but is actually a graphical program.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Both Free Pascal and QB64 are maintained and under relatively-active development, with their most recent releases in 2021&amp;hellip; but they are mostly ignored because they expose arcane languages that most people have no interest in these days.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="real-contemporary-console-ides">&amp;ldquo;Real&amp;rdquo; contemporary console IDEs&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>So what are we left with for &lt;em>modern&lt;/em> languages today?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The state of the art seems to be &lt;a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs">Doom Emacs&lt;/a>, or even &lt;a href="https://helix-editor.com/">Helix&lt;/a>. These editors are very powerful and, thanks to various plugins, offer reasonable IDE-like experiences. That said, if you ask me, none of these provide the same kind of experience that the previous Borland products offered: their interfaces are obscure and, due to their multi-language nature, they work OK for almost everything but they aren&amp;rsquo;t great for anything. &amp;ldquo;Jack of all trades, master of none&amp;rdquo; if you will.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any case, the preferred &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; TUI editor, based on what I observed in the deranged &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/discussions/16440">microsoft/terminal#16440&lt;/a> discussion, seems to be&amp;hellip; &lt;a href="https://www.nano-editor.org/">GNU Nano&lt;/a>&amp;hellip; which OK, it works, but first: it&amp;rsquo;s no IDE, and second, to me this looks like WordStar. Yeah, I know it isn&amp;rsquo;t WordStar: if you want WordStar, the closest you&amp;rsquo;ll find is &lt;a href="https://joe-editor.sourceforge.io/">Joe&lt;/a>, but the &lt;em>looks&lt;/em> of Nano remind me of my first experiences with a word processor back in the CP/M days. Here, look:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2023-12-25-nano.png" class="with-border">
&lt;figcaption>The GNU Nano editor in its default setup, with an empty file open.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>So even though we &lt;em>do&lt;/em> have powerful console editors these days, they don&amp;rsquo;t quite offer the same usable experience we had 30 years ago. In fact, it feels like during these 30 years, we regressed in many ways, and only now are reaching feature parity with some of the features we used to have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is natural that TUIs diminished in popularity once graphical OSes gained traction, and it is somewhat interesting that they are making a comeback just now. As for why, I think we have to thank the invention of &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">LSP&lt;/a> for most of the recent progress in this area. TUI editors were &amp;ldquo;on hold&amp;rdquo; for many years because building IDE features for them was a lot of effort and their small maintainer base could not afford to implement them. LSP unlocked access to existing language-specific integrations and reinfused interest in the old-and-trusty Vim and Emacs. Hopefully, the upcoming &lt;a href="https://build-server-protocol.github.io/">BSP&lt;/a> will do even more to make these TUIs more IDE-like.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="why-tui-ides-anyway">Why TUI IDEs anyway?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>It is fair to ask &amp;ldquo;Who cares? Every desktop and laptop runs a graphical OS now!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it&amp;rsquo;s a good question. In general, you probably &lt;em>don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em> want a TUI IDE. If VSCode is your jam, its remoting abilities are superb and VSCode has a reasonably good graphical interface without being a full-blown IDE. But there are a few things that VSCode doesn&amp;rsquo;t give us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first is that a TUI IDE is excellent for work on remote machines&amp;mdash;even better than VSCode. You can SSH into &lt;em>any&lt;/em> machine with ease and launch the IDE. &lt;a href="/2015/09/my-coding-workflow.html">Combine it with tmux and you get &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo; multitasking.&lt;/a> Yes, you could instead use a remote desktop client instead of SSH, but I&amp;rsquo;ve always found them clunky due to lag and the improper integration with the local desktop shortcuts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second is that &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source">VSCode&amp;rsquo;s remote extensions are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> open source&lt;/a>, which isn&amp;rsquo;t a major problem&amp;hellip; except for the fact that they don&amp;rsquo;t work on, say, FreeBSD and there is no way to fix them. So this makes it impossible for me to remote into my primary development server with VSCode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the third is&amp;hellip; reduced resource consumption.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="bloat-everywhere">Bloat everywhere&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t leave without ranting about &amp;ldquo;bloat&amp;rdquo; for a little bit. Borland Turbo C++, with all its bells and whistles (the UI, the C++ toolchain, the integrated manuals&amp;hellip;), is less than 9 MB after installation and ran within 640kb of RAM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For comparison, Helix is 16 MB on disk, which is pretty impressive (and honestly unexpected), but Doom Emacs is about 500 MBs and consumes many MBs of RAM. Note, however, that none of these numbers account for the language toolchains or help systems, and toolchains nowadays rank in the GBs of disk space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; IDEs, we have to jump to graphical programs like IntelliJ or VSCode. VSCode, for example, is about 350 MBs on disk (surprisingly less than Doom Emacs) but it will eat your computer for lunch: it&amp;rsquo;s Electron after all. I have noticed very significant savings in laptop battery life by dropping VSCode and moving to Doom Emacs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the question I want to part with is: have we advanced &lt;em>much&lt;/em> in 30 years? Modern IDEs have some better refactoring tools, better features, and support more languages, but fundamentally&amp;hellip; they haven&amp;rsquo;t changed much. The only major difference that we are &lt;em>starting&lt;/em> to see might be AI-assisted coding, but this is a feature mostly provided by a remote service, not even by the installed code!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s all for today. On my side, I&amp;rsquo;ll happily continue using &lt;em>all of&lt;/em> Doom Emacs, Vim, VSCode, and IntelliJ depending on the situation. Merry Christmas if this is your thing!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bazel interview at Software Engineering Daily</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/bazel-interview-at-software-engineering.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 09:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/bazel-interview-at-software-engineering.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Just a bit over 2 months ago, on October 5th, 2023, Jordi Mon Companys interviewed me about Bazel for an episode in the &lt;a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/">Software Engineering Daily&lt;/a> podcast.

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t have time to listen to the whole 45 minutes, or if you want to get a sense of what you will get out of it, here is a recap of everything we touched on. Every paragraph is annotated with the rough time where the discussion starts so that you can jump right in to whatever interests you the most.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-background">My background&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[01:10]&lt;/strong> Introduction about myself. Really brief overview about my roles and the companies I&amp;rsquo;ve been at throughout the years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[01:58]&lt;/strong> A retrospective about how I got into computers and why I think things were much easier to dive into years ago. In other words, a plug for &lt;a href="https://www.endbasic.dev/">EndBASIC&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[03:34]&lt;/strong> My history with open source projects and how I got into Linux, the BSDs, and why I ended up as a contributor to NetBSD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[05:05]&lt;/strong> How my background helped me join Google as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), even if I did not have much experience in systems administration. SRE is a really cool position because of the many paths that lead into it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[05:51]&lt;/strong> Why I moved years later to the Bazel team as a software engineer while remaining at Google.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="introduction-to-bazel">Introduction to Bazel&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[06:57]&lt;/strong> Google and internal tools. Why Google invented &amp;ldquo;everything&amp;rdquo; in house, including Bazel and the distributed build services it relies on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[08:35]&lt;/strong> Brief introduction to what Bazel is: a polyglot build system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[10:11]&lt;/strong> Thoughts on the distinction&amp;mdash;or rather, lack thereof&amp;mdash;between build systems and CI systems. While they have been traditionally thought of as separate, they are pretty intertwined and you need your CI system to be as aware of the build process as possible to be maximally efficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[10:56]&lt;/strong> Brief introduction to what the Starlark language is, why it exists, and how it is used to define Bazel rules. Includes a brief explanation of major Bazel concepts such as targets, rules, and actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[13:28]&lt;/strong> Thoughts on why Bazel is a good fit for a monorepo.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="build-incrementality">Build incrementality&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[14:45]&lt;/strong> Description of how build incrementality works and how Bazel determines which parts of the build graph to rebuild. Covers how traditional file systems use timestamps, how Bazel tries to do something better, and how you can do even fancier stuff if you have the right support from the file system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[17:36]&lt;/strong> Deeper dive into Skyframe: the component within Bazel that tracks the build graph and helps decide which parts need to be rebuilt every time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[19:02]&lt;/strong> Separation of local machine vs. remote machine resources: what parts of the build happen where? Is the build graph &amp;ldquo;in the cloud&amp;rdquo; too?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[20:06]&lt;/strong> Notes on how Bazel decides how to behave (spolier alert: manual configuration) and a mini-rant about Bazel having too many flags.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="dependency-management">Dependency management&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[21:12]&lt;/strong> Exploring dependency management for third-party packages, focusing on how Google had traditionally done this in their monorepo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[22:16]&lt;/strong> Deeper dive into the history of dependency management by looking into how the workspace file came to be and why it has limitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[24:01]&lt;/strong> Extending Bazel, or rather the difference between the Java core vs. the Starlark ecosystem, and how the Build API bridges the gap between the two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[25:34]&lt;/strong> Brief digression into the newly-released &lt;a href="https://buck2.build/">Buck2&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="bazel-migrations">Bazel migrations&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[26:23]&lt;/strong> Migrating to Bazel at a company like Snowflake. Exploration of where the difficulties arise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[28:50]&lt;/strong> Discussion on how platform engineering is becoming its own thing, with the goal of building developer tools and experiences as company-internal products.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[30:44]&lt;/strong> Highlights of the primary (positive) benefits for the users after a Bazel migration: fast builds and &lt;a href="/2020/12/google-no-clean-builds.html">no more &amp;ldquo;make clean&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="remote-execution">Remote execution&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[32:59]&lt;/strong> Integration of Bazel with remote services. Differences between remote caching and remote execution, and an exploration of different implementations of each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[34:25]&lt;/strong> Brief discussion on generating SBOMs and how Bazel&amp;rsquo;s dependency tracking is perfectly aligned to provide these.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[35:26]&lt;/strong> Sandboxing. A discussion on the different levels of what you can restrict per platform and the trade-offs in complexity and performance. In other words: sandboxing is a spectrum.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="forward-looking-plans">Forward-looking plans&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[37:15]&lt;/strong> Bazel&amp;rsquo;s future plans. Not my plans nor predictions, but rather what&amp;rsquo;s coming up in Bazel 7. (&lt;a href="https://blog.bazel.build/2023/12/11/bazel-7-release.html">Already released&lt;/a> at the time of this writing.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[38:14]&lt;/strong> My wishlist for Bazel, which is basically &lt;a href="/2015/04/on-bazel-and-open-source.html">what I brought up back in 2015&lt;/a>: it&amp;rsquo;d be awesome if it was smaller so that it could be usable in the smaller projects that lie in the foundations of the Unix systems we use today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[38:49]&lt;/strong> Thoughts on the upcoming BazelCon. (It was awesome. See &lt;a href="/2023/10/bazelcon-2023-et-al-trip-report.html">my attendance report&lt;/a>!)&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="source-control">Source control&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>[39:30]&lt;/strong> Digression on source control, how Git is not great for monorepos, and how Google ended up building their own thing after using Perforce for many years. Also a brief explanation on how Bazel can leverage source control system integrations for better performance.&lt;/p>

They also had this other feature called noisy disks 💾 and loud fans 🪭. Uh wait. Features? Why &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;annoyances&amp;rdquo;?! 🧵👇&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>You see, these bright lights and loud noises acted as canaries 🐦 in a performance mine. They gave developers a chance to notice when things were off performance-wise. If your code abused the CPU or the hard disk by mistake, you could tell right away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nowadays, developer machines tend to be quiet under heavy load, and the vast majority of laptops don&amp;rsquo;t even have lights anymore. The obvious example are Macs: they haven&amp;rsquo;t had hard disk LEDs for a really long time, and since the M1, they are silent and cold too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These characteristics are nice from a usability perspective. Unfortunately, as a developer, you now need to first &lt;em>imagine&lt;/em> that something is wrong before even deciding to look for a problem. If the thought never crosses your mind, then you may never look.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me give you a few examples of the kinds of inefficiencies that I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. These would have been trivially noticed by the presence of indicators. These are all based on real-world situations I faced at some point in the (recent) past.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>🪵 In a project I worked on, our development builds started writing about 80 MB of log messages &lt;em>per second&lt;/em> to disk. No matter how you look at it, that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>a lot&lt;/em> of disk traffic, and yet&amp;hellip; the problematic code passed code review and was merged into the main branch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only indication that something was wrong was when &lt;em>other&lt;/em> developers came asking for help because their local disk space was running out faster than usual. There was no other symptom behind the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;d hope that this inefficiency would be caught while qualifying the new release for production because, in theory, such logging waste would translate in an increase in CPU consumption or network bandwidth. But&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure the issue would have been noticed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>🌐 In another project I worked on, I noticed that Bazel took an incredibly long time to complete some actions. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I looked in detail that I saw it stuck in a loop fetching the same remote artifact over and over again due to connection resets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The build completed successfully after many minutes once Bazel gave up on the downloads and fell back local execution. There was no reason to suspect that something was wrong other than &amp;ldquo;these actions are just huge&amp;rdquo;. In reality, though, there was a bug somewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>🧱 Just today, I was in a video call and noticed that my laptop was reading 100MB/s from disk non-stop. I concluded the meeting but the disk reads didn&amp;rsquo;t stop. A quick peek at &lt;code>top&lt;/code> showed something called &lt;code>WallpaperVideoExtension&lt;/code> that seemed to have gone rogue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This background process was consuming one full CPU, but such load wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough to make the system feel slower nor noisier. I suppose I would eventually have noticed that the battery was running out quicker than usual, but maybe not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Killing the process made the problem go away and the constant disk reads stopped. Looking online, I find other instances of &lt;code>WallpaperVideoExtension&lt;/code> consuming lots of CPU and memory, so this seems to be a bug. But if it&amp;rsquo;s common, why wasn&amp;rsquo;t it noticed in the first place?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In any case, this last scenario gives you a hint 🔍 as to where I&amp;rsquo;m going: how did I even notice this last problem? After all, my M1 Mac was working just fine: it was just slightly warmer than usual but there was no loud fan noise nor lights to tell me about disk activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer is simple: I have an omnipresent performance monitor in my screen that shows CPU load, memory pressure, disk I/O throughput, and network traffic. This monitor is always visible, taking little space in the menu bar or the task bar.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="/images/2023-12-15-istat-menus.png" class="with-border">

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Every time I sense something is a tiny bit off, I glance 👀 at the monitor. You cannot imagine how many times I&amp;rsquo;ve gone &amp;ldquo;huh, that&amp;rsquo;s interesting&amp;rdquo; by seeing unexpected activity and then went on to discover big performance problems somewhere in the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My recommendation is that you stop what you are doing and go and install such a performance monitor &lt;em>right now&lt;/em>. I&amp;rsquo;d even argue that having one always visible should be a hard requirement for any development machine and corp IT departments should preinstall one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally, I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of &lt;a href="https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/">iStat Menus&lt;/a> for macOS and have been using it for years. But if macOS is not your thing, you can find similar tools for other platforms like &lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3010/system-monitor-next/">system-monitor-next&lt;/a> for Gnome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, these monitors only help if you develop on your local machine&amp;mdash;a workflow that&amp;rsquo;s becoming exceedingly rare. If, instead, you SSH into remote virtual machines to do your development or use VSCode&amp;rsquo;s remote features, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a different answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a situation I face right now. The modern ThinkStation I have in the garage is well-equipped with useful lights&amp;hellip; but I only access it over SSH for development so those lights and its disk noises are kinda useless from where I sit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what the right answer here is. If you have been around for a while, you may remember &lt;a href="http://gkrellm.srcbox.net">GKrellM&lt;/a>, which I was an avid user of. This system monitor had the ability to display &lt;em>remote&lt;/em> machine activity and I&amp;rsquo;d love to have that again.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
