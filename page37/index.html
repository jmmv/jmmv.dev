        I couldn't keep up with my plans yesterday.  I started by walking through the Golden Gate Bridge (both ways) and then, on my way back, I ended up visiting Japantown and the area around the City Hall.  I mean, I didn't visit the Golden Gate Park itself... but not a big deal since it seems similar to Central Park according to the maps.At night, I met just one NetBSD developer in the 21st Amendment bar.244 more photos to process.Today, time to visit the Berkeley campus.

        Yesterday was my 2nd day of vacations at San Francisco but ended up so tired that I couldn't sit down to write this post.  What did I do?  Basically, yesterday was a walking day. I got out of the hotel early in the morning (around 9am) and came back at 4pm, just to leave again at 5.30pm and return at 8.30pm.  That's a lot of hours of wandering around!Basically, my path started at the hotel and I headed to the North Beach neighborhood through Downtown.  From there, I climbed up to the Coit Tower; these hills are painful!  Then I took the Powell steps to get to the Piers and walked north-west around the coast to end in the Aquatic Park. After that, a walk to the hotel to rest a little bit. And afterwards, headed Downtown again to have dinner at a place called Bocadillos, hoping that I'd find something similar to the Spanish "bocadillos"; no luck though, but the food was OK. At last, while returning home, I took pictures of some cool buildings decorated for Christmas.As a result, 202 more photos to process...  I'll eventually post some, I guess.And the plan for today is to cross the Golden Gate, visit the Golden Gate Park and, in the evening, meet some local NetBSDers.  Will see how that goes.

        That's it!  I'm in SF after my first "vacations" day. The trip, door to door, has taken around 12 hours; I got up at 4.45am in NYC, took the flight at 8.30am in JFK, arrived to SFO at 12.00pm and got to the hotel at around 2.00pm (all of these local times in their respective places; three-hour difference between eastern and western coasts).  No cabs, which is what enlarged the total time a noticeable amount.The city seems pretty nice so far.  More laid back than Manhattan... but still overpriced.  And I miss some things from NYC such as the 24/7 availability of virtually everything (note, it is Sunday today!).  Even though, I have been only able to explore the surroundings of the hotel today &mdash; that is, Union Square and a bit of SoMA &mdash; so this opinion may change in the following days.  Dunno what I'll do in these other days yet, though.I've taken lots of pictures (103) but most of them are worthless due to poor lighting :(  Anyway, I guess I'll eventually share some of them.Now, almost time to go to sleep.  Jet lag is kicking in.  I don't want to think how bad this will be when I go back to Spain!

        That's it. My internship at Google finished this past Thursday (that is one day and a half ago) and I'm going back to Spain on December 2nd. A week and a half to go and my time at NYC is over. Quick summary: the internship has been great, working at Google is amazing and my project was more or less finished.I'll provide more details about the whole experience later when I'm back to my country, but now is vacations time. I really need to relax a bit; haven't had vacations for more than a year and a half!  And, when I get back, I'll have to start working on my Ph.D. immediately.So what am I going to do? I'm leaving to San Francisco tomorrow morning and I'll spend four days there by myself, exploring that other nice city. I'll be back to NYC for thanksgiving and then use the rest of the days to visit a couple of museums, buy presents and, if time permits, visit Washington DC.Next post will probably be from San Francisco ;)  C ya.

        The Google SoC 2008 Mentor Summit is now officially over. The summit has taken place during the whole weekend and has been pretty intensive. The organization of the whole event has been excellent thanks to the hard work of Leslie Hawthorn among others; sorry, can't remember your names... I'm very bad at this.We have had multiple sessions, ranging from technical ones such as distributed version control systems to more political ones such as how to deal with assholes in open source projects. There were lots of passionate people in these talks, and it was quite interesting to see it all. The cool thing, though, as opposed to other conferences, is that everyone here comes from a different project and background, so you get to see lots of different opinions and points of views for each topic.As regards the Google HQ campus, it is great. I thought the NYC offices were good, but these are spectacular to see. Unfortunately, there is not much to do out of them... so I'm not sure if it could be so good to work here for a long time.Now, I'm sitting in the San Jose airport (SJC) waiting for the flight back to NYC. Amazingly, there is free internet wireless connection and electrical plugs! Very, very nice detail. And there is few people around, which makes it very quiet and relaxed.Oh, and to those who will decipher this: some more mini golf training during the summit :P

        I've landed this morning in San Francisco at 9.00am (which means I left NYC at 6.00am!) and went straight down to the Google Headquarters in Mountain View. No sleep at all except for a little bit of pseudo-sleep in the plane.  The Google campus is really nice. It puts the NYC offices in an inferior level than I thought :P  But the only problem is that the area surrounding the campus is basically empty. Very small houses and lots of space between them, which is not bad per se... but means that there really is not much to do.Anyway. What am I doing here? I am attending the Google Summer of Code 2008 Mentors Summit this weekend, but came a bit earlier to be able to do a couple of meetings with coworkers in the Mountain View office. Pretty exhausting day, and it is not close to over yet!Just enjoy the few photos I've taken so far.PS: Been playing mini-golf on-board until I got an unasked segmentation fault.

        A rather long while ago, I published a little teaser on std::set and people seemed to like it quite a bit. So here goes another one based on a problem a friend has found at work today. I hope to reproduce the main idea behind the problem correctly, but my memory is a bit fuzzy.Can you guess why the following program fails to compile due to an error in the call to equals from within main? Bonus points if you don't build it.struct data {    int field;};templateclass base {public:    virtual ~base(void)    {    }    virtual bool equals(const Data& a,                        const Data& b) const    {        return a == b;    }};class child : public base {public:    bool equals(const data& a,                const data& b) const    {        return a.field == b.field;    }};intmain(void){    data d1, d2;    base* c = new child();    (void)c->equals(d1, d2);    delete c;    return 0;}Tip: If you make base::equals a pure abstract method, the code builds fine.
