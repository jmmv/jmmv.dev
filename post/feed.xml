Back then, I did not fully comprehend what I was doing and why the tools I used were impressive given the constraints of the hardware we had. Having gained more knowledge throughout the years, it is now really fun to pick up DOSBox to re-experience those programs and compare them with our current state of affairs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, I want to look at the pure text-based IDEs that we had in that era before Windows eclipsed the PC industry. I want to do this because those IDEs had little to envy from the IDEs of today&amp;mdash;yet it feels as if we went through a dark era where we lost most of those features for years and they are only resurfacing now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If anything, stay for a nostalgic ride back in time and a little rant on &amp;ldquo;bloat&amp;rdquo;. But, more importantly, read on to gain perspective on what existed before so that you can evaluate future feature launches more critically.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bazel interview at Software Engineering Daily</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/bazel-interview-at-software-engineering.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 09:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/bazel-interview-at-software-engineering.html</guid><description>Just a bit over 2 months ago, on October 5th, 2023, Jordi Mon Companys interviewed me about Bazel for an episode in the Software Engineering Daily podcast.

In my Windows?</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/a-cli-text-editor-in-my-windows.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 14:45:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/a-cli-text-editor-in-my-windows.html</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s more likely than you think!
In a surprising twist of events, Microsoft is exploring the addition of a command-line (CLI) text editor to Windows. If you ask me, not having a CLI text editor on Windows is mind-boggling: you can access a Windows machine via SSH these days, so not having an editor that works in the console is a big handicap for remote system administration. So, should Windows bundle a CLI text editor?</description></item><item><title>Strings, encodings, NULs and Bazel</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/strings-encodings-nuls-and-bazel.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2023 10:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/strings-encodings-nuls-and-bazel.html</guid><description>Just yesterday, Twitter user @vkrajacic wrote:
Advice for new C programmers: &amp;ldquo;Avoid null-terminated strings; they&amp;rsquo;re outdated, inefficient and impractical.&amp;rdquo;
Create your own type with basic functions. It&amp;rsquo;s not that hard, and it goes a long way. One of the benefits of this approach, among others, is slicing without copying.
This suggestion has its merits and I understand where it is coming from: performance. You see: the traditional way to represent strings in C is to use NUL-terminated byte arrays.</description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-12-03-threads.jpg" length="589063" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: November 2023 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/links-november-2023-edition.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2023 10:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/links-november-2023-edition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to the second edition of my &amp;ldquo;interesting links&amp;rdquo; recap, this time covering the month of November 2023.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For context, what follows is my manual curation of cool articles, videos, and projects I stumbled upon during this time period. But this is not &lt;em>just&lt;/em> a dump of links: &lt;em>each link is accompanied by a 1-paragraph commentary&lt;/em> that justifies why I thought the material was cool, why it is relevant to this publication and, more importantly, an attempt to nudge you into reading it.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-31-links.png" length="56457" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Windows NT: Peeking into the cradle</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/windows-nt-peeking-into-the-cradle.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2023 09:40:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/windows-nt-peeking-into-the-cradle.html</guid><description>&lt;p>It's strange... but I've been able to finish reading a book cover-to-cover that's not a book for my kids. It's hard for me to get hooked into books and find the time to read them. I think the one I finished before this might have been 10 PRINT, and that was over a year ago. This time, though, I completed the book on the story behind the creation of Windows NT: namely, "Showstopper!" in its short form, written by G. Pascal Zachary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reading the story of how Windows NT came to be was entertaining, as it is a story of the system itself and the dynamics between Dave Cutler, the original designer and lead for NT, and the other people involved in the project. I was shy of being 10 years old when Windows NT launched and I didn't comprehend what was going on in the operating systems world and why this release was such a big deal. Reading the book made me learn various new things about the development process, the role of Microsoft in that era, and allowed me to settle some questions I've had over the years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article is a mixture of a book review and a collection of thoughts and reflections that the book evoked. Let's begin because we have a lot of ground to cover.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-11-24-showstopper-pile.jpg" length="180711" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Code reviews: A success story</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/code-reviews-a-success-story.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2023 13:50:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/code-reviews-a-success-story.html</guid><description>Code reviews have a bad rep: they are antagonistic in nature and, sometimes, pure red tape. Some argue that they are bad practice; others say that peer programming is better. And while these may be true, I want to tell you a story about a case where code reviews worked well!
Meet X: a junior engineer in the Bazel team circa 2018, tasked to implement two features: A and B. As you may know, Google is big into code reviews&amp;mdash;and their tooling for this is awesome; believe me&amp;mdash;so this was the standard process for X to get his code checked in.</description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-11-21-code-review.png" length="134980" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>SSH agent forwarding and tmux done right</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/ssh-agent-forwarding-and-tmux-done.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 08:50:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/ssh-agent-forwarding-and-tmux-done.html</guid><description>The SSH agent is a little daemon that holds your private keys in memory. This is particularly handy when your keys are protected by a passphrase: you can unlock and add your keys to the agent once and, from then on, any SSH client such as ssh(1) can interact with the keys without asking you for the passphrase again.
The SSH agent becomes even handier when you primarily work on a remote workstation over SSH.</description></item><item><title>Why do I know shell, and how can you?</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/why-do-i-know-shell-and-how-can-you.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/why-do-i-know-shell-and-how-can-you.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Why do you know so much shell?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> is a question I&amp;rsquo;m getting a lot at work lately. So yeah, why? And how can you learn it too? There is no secret here: I know the shell well because I was &amp;ldquo;forced&amp;rdquo; to write tools in it for a while and, because of that, I made a conscious effort to learn the language and get better at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You see, most people that write shell don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with it. They stitch together whatever works into a script and call it a day, making a bunch of spaghetti even if it goes against the coding best practices they already know. And when they encounter some odd syntax they don&amp;rsquo;t recognize, their reaction is to say &amp;ldquo;this has to be rewritten in Python!&amp;rdquo; instead of taking a breath and trying to really understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that plenty of senior engineers scoff at shell scripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it is true: the shell is arcane and has many flaws as a programming language. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to convince you to start writing new tools in it. But the shell is also an incredible rapid prototyping language, and you can use it to solve business problems really quickly and with surprisingly little code. If you pause for a second to learn it, you&amp;rsquo;ll realize that you can bend tradition and write maintainable shell code too. Hear out how I got into writing so much shell and how you can get better at it too.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-11-10-sh-manpage.jpg" length="425448" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>End-to-end tool testing with Bazel and shtk</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/end-to-end-tool-testing-with-bazel.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 07:50:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/end-to-end-tool-testing-with-bazel.html</guid><description>&lt;p>If you use Bazel, your project is of moderate size. And because your project is of moderate size, it almost-certainly builds one or more binaries, at least one of which is a CLI tool. But let&amp;rsquo;s face it: you don&amp;rsquo;t have end-to-end testing for those tools, do you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em>sure&lt;/em> you have split the binary&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>main&lt;/code> function into its own file so that the rest of the tool can be put in a library, and I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em>extra-sure&lt;/em> that you have unit tests for such library. But&amp;hellip; those tests do little to verify the functionality and quality of the tool &lt;em>as experienced by the end user&lt;/em>. Consider: What exactly does the tool print to the console on success? Does it show errors nicely when they happen, or does it dump internal stack traces? How does it handle unknown flags or bad arguments? Is the built-in help message nicely rendered when your terminal is really wide? What if the terminal is narrow?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You must write end-to-end tests for your tools but, usually, that isn‚Äôt easy to do. Until today. Combining shtk with Bazel via the new &lt;code>rules_shtk&lt;/code> ruleset makes it trivial to write tests that verify the behavior of your CLI tools&amp;mdash;no matter what language they are written in&amp;mdash;and in this article I‚Äôm going to show you how.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-11-04-bazel-clamp.jpg" length="572746" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: October 2023 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/links-october-2023-edition.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 12:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/links-october-2023-edition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Inspired by the works of &lt;a href="https://eatonphil.com/">Phil Eaton&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ve been highlighting articles and projects that I find interesting in &lt;del>Twitter&lt;/del> X and Mastodon. Some of these posts were more &amp;ldquo;successful&amp;rdquo; than I had expected, which I take to mean that doing this is interesting to you all. So, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good idea to periodically collect them all in a post with a very brief commentary on each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a recap of the interesting articles that came my way in October 2023. This does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> mean that these articles were published during this period: some of them are older but I just (re)discovered them now. I&amp;rsquo;ll avoid referencing my own articles: you can find those by &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/archive.html">in the archive&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-31-links.png" length="56457" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>BazelCon 2023 et al. trip report</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/bazelcon-2023-et-al-trip-report.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 03:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/bazelcon-2023-et-al-trip-report.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted. I just came back to Seattle from a 10-day trip in which I attended three different Bazel events: the Build Meetup in Reykjavik, the Bazel Community Day in Munich, and BazelCon 2023 in Munich too. Oh, and because I was on the other side of the world, I also paid a visit to my family in Spain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attending these events has been incredibly useful and productive: I got exposure to many ideas and discussions that would just not happen online, I got to build connections with very interesting people and, of course, it has also been super fun too to reconnect with old coworkers and friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article contains the summary of the things I learned and the things I want to follow up on. These are just a bunch of cleaned-up notes which I took and are in the context of &lt;em>my&lt;/em> work with &lt;a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel&lt;/a> at &lt;a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake&lt;/a> and &lt;em>my&lt;/em> interests on build tools, so this is not endorsed by Snowflake.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-30-bazelcon.jpg" length="663230" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Hello, Blog System/5!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/hello-blog-system5.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 16:14:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/hello-blog-system5.html</guid><description>Blog System/5 is my new Substack publication in which I write about the variety of software and systems engineering topics that pique my interest.

What we haven&amp;rsquo;t shared yet is that we have deployed our own Build Barn cluster to support Bazel&amp;rsquo;s remote execution features. We have chosen to run our own build farm service for resource governance and security purposes, but also because the behavior of this system impacts the developer experience so directly that we want to have full in-house control and knowledge of it.</description></item></channel></rss>
