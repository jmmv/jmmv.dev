        Wow.  I have just realized that I have not blogged at all about the project that has kept me busy for the past two months!  Not good, not good.  "What is this project?", I hear.  Well, this project is Kyua.A bit of background first: the Automated Testing Framework, or ATF for short, is a project that I started during the Summer of Code of 2007. The major goal of ATF was, and still is, to provide a testing framework for the NetBSD operating system. The ATF framework is composed of a set of libraries to aid in the implementation of test cases in C, C++ and shell, and a set of tools to ease the execution of such test cases (atf-run) and to generate reports of the execution (atf-report).At that point in time, I would say that the original design of ATF was nice.  It made test programs intelligent enough to execute their test cases in a sandboxed environment.  Such test programs could be executed on their own (without atf-run) and they exposed the same behavior as when they were run within the runtime monitor, atf-run.  On paper this was nice, but in practice it has become a hassle.  Additionally, some of these design decisions mean that particular features (in particular, parallel execution of tests) cannot be implemented at all.  At the end of 2009 and beginning of 2010, I did some major refactorings to the code to make the test programs dumber and to move much of the common logic into atf-run, which helped a lot in fixing the major shortcomings encountered by the users... but the result is that, today, we have a huge mess.Additionally, while ATF is composed of different modules conceptually separate from each other, there is some hard implementation couplings among them that impose severe restrictions during development.  Tangentially, during the past 2 years of working at Google (and coding mainly in Python), I have been learning new neat programming techniques to make code more testable... and these are not followed at all by ATF.  In fact, while the test suite of ATF seems very extensive, it definitely is not: there are many corner cases that are not tested and for which implementing tests would be very hard (which means that nasty bugs have easily sneaked in into releases).Lastly, a very important point that affects directly the success of the project.  Outsiders that want to contribute to ATF have a huge entry barrier: the source repository is managed by Monotone, the bug tracker is provided by Gnats (a truly user-unfriendly system), and the mailing lists are offered by majordomo. None of these tools is "standard" by today's common practices, and some of them are tied to NetBSD's hosting which puts some outsiders off.For all the reasons above and as this year has been moving along, I have gotten fed up with the ATF code base.  (OK, things are not that bad... but in my mind they do ;-)  And here is where Kyua comes into the game.Kyua is a project to address all the shortcomings listed above.  First of all, the project uses off-the-shelf development tools that should make it much, much easier for external people to contribute.  Secondly, the project intends to be much more modular, providing a clear separation between the different components and providing code that is easily testable.  Lastly, Kyua intends to remain compatible with ATF so that there are no major disruptions for users.  You can (and should) think of Kyua as ATF 2.0, not as a vastly different framework.As of today, Kyua implements a runtime engine that is on par, feature-wise, to the one provided by atf-run.  It is able to run test cases implemented with the ATF libraries and it is able to test itself.  It currently contains 355 test cases that run in less than 20 seconds.  (Compare that to the 536 test cases of ATF, which take over a minute to run, and Kyua is still really far from catching up with all the functionality of ATF.)  Next actions involve implementing reports generation and configuration files.Anyway.  For more details on the project, I recommend you to read the original posting to atf-devel or the project's main page and wiki.  And of course, you can also download the preliminary source code to take a look!Enjoy :-)

        Thanks to Antti Kantee's efforts, atf is seeing increasing visibility in the NetBSD community during the past few months. But one of the major concerns that we keep hearing from our developers is "Where is the documentation?".  Certainly I have been doing a pretty bad job at that, and the current in-tree documents are a bit disorganized.To fix the short-term problem, I have written a little tutorial that covers pretty much every aspect that you need to know to write atf tests and, in particular, how to write such tests for the NetBSD source tree.  Please refer to the official announcement for more details.Comments are, of course, welcome!  And if you can use this tutorial to write your first tests for NetBSD, let me know :-)

        Ladies and gentlemen: I have just released ATF 0.10!  This release with such a magic number includes lots of new exciting features and provides a much simplified source tree.Dive into the 0.10 release page for details!I'm now working in getting this release into the NetBSD tree to remove some of the custom patches that have been superseded by the official release. Will be there soon.And all this while I am a meetBSD in Kraków :-)

        Antti Kantee has been, for a while, writing unit/integration tests for the puffs and rump systems (for which he is the author) shipped with NetBSD.  Recently, he has been working on fixing the NetBSD test suite to report 0 failures in the i386 platform so as to encourage developers to keep it that way while doing changes to the tree.  The goal is to require developers to run the tests themselves before submitting code.Antti has just published an introductory article, titled Testing NetBSD: Easy Does It, that describes what ATF and Anita are, how to use them and how they can help in NetBSD development and deployment.  Nice work!

        Oops! Looks like I forgot to announce the release of ATF 0.9 here a couple of weeks ago. Just a short notice that the formal release has been available since June 3rd and that 0.9 has been in NetBSD since June 4th!You can also enjoy a shiny-new web site! It even includes a FAQ!And, as a side note: I have added a test target to the NetBSD Makefiles, so now it's possible to just do make test within any subdirectory of src/tests/ and get what you expect.

        During the past few months, I've got into the habit of using a bug tracker to organize my tasks at the work place. People assign tickets to me to get things done and I also create and self-assign tickets to myself to keep them as a reminder of the mini-projects to be accomplished. Sincerely, this approach works very well for me and keeps me focused.Since then, I've been wishing to have a similar system set up for ATF.  Yeah, we could use the Gnats installation provided by NetBSD... but I hate this issue tracking system.  It's ancient, ugly, and I do really want a web interface to manage my tickets through.So, this weekend, I finally took some time and set up a Trac installation for ATF to provide a decent bug/task tracking system. The whole Apache plus Trac setup was more complex than I imagined, but I do hope that the results will pay off :-)Take a look at the official announcement for more details!

        Almost a year ago, I decided to give a try to AdSense. And, so far, the "earnings" have been ~30 EUR which I cannot even cash. Given this and how ugly and disturbing the ads look on the front page, I have disabled them. (I think the ads have gotten much worse over time... but as I do not pay attention to the front page, I didn't see them.) Thanks to Roman Valls for pointing this out!
