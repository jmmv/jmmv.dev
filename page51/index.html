        One of the key goals of atf is to let the end user — not only the developer — to easily run the tests after their corresponding application is installed.  (In our case, application = NetBSD, but remember that atf also aims to be independent from NetBSD.) This also means, among other things, that the user must not need to have any development tool installed (the comp.tgz set) to run the tests, which rules out using make(1)... how glad I'm of that! :-)Based on this idea, each application using atf will install its tests alongside its binaries, being the currently location /usr/tests/&lt;application&gt;.  These tests will be accompanied by a control file — an Atffile — that lists which tests have to be run and in which order.  (In the future this may also include configuration or some other settings.)  Later on, the user will be able to launch the atf-run tool inside any of these directories to automatically run all the provided tests, and the tool will generate a pretty report while the tests are run.Given that atf is an application, it has to be tested.  After some work today, it is finally possible for atf to test itself! :-)  Of course, it also comes with several bootstrap tests, written using GNU Autotest, to ensure that atf's core functionality works before one can run the tests written using atf itself.  Otherwise one could get unexpected passes due to bugs in the atf code.This is what atf installs:$ find /tmp/local/tests/tmp/local/tests/tmp/local/tests/atf/tmp/local/tests/atf/Atffile/tmp/local/tests/atf/units/tmp/local/tests/atf/units/Atffile/tmp/local/tests/atf/units/t_file_handle/tmp/local/tests/atf/units/t_filesystem/tmp/local/tests/atf/units/t_pipe/tmp/local/tests/atf/units/t_pistream/tmp/local/tests/atf/units/t_postream/tmp/local/tests/atf/units/t_systembuf$All the t_* files are test programs written using the features provided by libatf.  As you can see, each directory provides an Atffile which lists the tests to run and the directories to descend into.The atf-run tool already works (*cough* it's code is ugly, really ugly) and returns an appropriate error code depending on the outcomes of the tests.  However, the report it generates is completely un-understandable.  This will be the next thing to attack: I want to be able to generate plain-text reports to be seen as the text progresses, but also to generate pretty HTML files.  To do the latter, the plan is to use some intermediate format such as XML and have another tool to do the formatting.

      <p>
        Today, I've attempted to build atf on a NetBSD 4.0_BETA2 system I've been setting up in a spare box I had around, as opposed to the Mac OS X system I'm using for daily development.  The build failed due to some well-understood problems, but there was an annoying one with respect to some calls to the standard XPG basename(3) and dirname(3) functions.According to the Mac OS X manual pages for those functions, they are supposed to take a const char * argument.  However, the NetBSD versions of these functions take a plain char * parameter instead &mdash; i.e., not a constant pointer.After Googling for some references and with advice from joerg@, I got the answer: it turns out that the XPG versions1 of basename and dirname can modify the input string by trimming trailing directory separators (even though the current implementation in NetBSD does not do that).  This makes no sense to me, but it's what the XPG4.2 and POSIX.1 standards specify.I've resolved this issue by simply re-implementing basename and dirname (which I wanted to do anyway), making my own versions take and return constant strings.  And to make things safer, I've added a check to the configure script that verifies if the basename and dirname implementations take a constant pointer and, in that (incorrect) case, use the standard functions to sanity-check the results of my own by means of an assertion.1 How not, the GNU libc library provides its own variations of basename and dirname.  However, including libgen.h forces the usage of the XPG versions.

        Aside from the libraries I already mentioned in a past post, atf1 will also provide several tools to run the tests.  An interesting part of the problem, though, is that many tests will be written in the POSIX shell language as that will be much easier than writing them in C or C++: the ability to rapidly prototype tests is a fundamental design goal; otherwise nobody could write them!However, providing two interfaces to the same framework (one in POSIX shell and one in C++) means that there could be a lot of code duplication in the two if not done properly.  Not to mention that sanely and safely implementing some of these features in shell scripting could be painful.In order to resolve the above problem, the atf will also provide several binary tools that will be helpers for the shell scripts.  Most of these tools will be installed in the libexec directory as they should not be exposed to the user, yet the shell scripts will need to be able to reach them.  The key idea will be to later build the shell interface on top of the binary one, reusing as much code as possible.So far I have the following tools:atf-config: Used to dynamically query information about atf's installation.  This is needed to let the shell scripts locate where the tools in libexec can be found (because they are not in the path!).atf-format: Pretty-prints a message (single- or multi-paragraph), wrapping it on terminal boundaries.atf-identify: Calculates a test program's identifier based on where it is placed in the file system.  Tests programs will be organized in a directory hierarchy, and each of them has to have a unique identifier.The next one to write, hopefully, will be atf-run: the tool to effectively execute multiple test programs in a row and collect their results.Oh, and in case you are wondering. Yes, I have decided to provide each tool as an independent binary instead of a big one that wraps them all (such as cvs(1)).  This is to keep them as small as possible — so that shell scripts can load them quickly — and because this seems to be more in the traditional Unix philosophy of having tools for doing very specific things :-)1 Should I spell it atf, ATF or Atf?

        I've already spent a bunch of time working on the packaging (as in what will end up in the .tar.gz distribution files) of atf even though it is still in very preliminary stages of development.  This involved:Preparing a clean and nice build framework, which due to the tools I'm using meant writing the configure.ac and Makefile.am files.  This involved adding some useful comments and, despite I'm familiar with these tools, re-reading part of the GNU Automake and GNU Autoconf manuals; this last step is something that many, many developers bypass and therefore end up with really messy scripts as if they weren't important.  (Read: if the package used some other tools, there'd be no reason to not write pretty and clean build files.)Preparing the package's documentation, or at least placeholders for it: I'm referring to the typical AUTHORS, COPYING, NEWS, README and TODO documents that many developers seem to treat as garbage and fill them up at the last minute before flushing out a release, ending with badly formatted texts full of typos.  Come on, that's the very first thing a user will see after unpacking a distribution file, so these ought to be pretty!Having spent a lot of time packaging software for pkgsrc and dealing with source code from other projects, I have to say that I've found dozens of packages that do not have the minimum quality one can expect in the above points.  I don't like to pinpoint, but I have to: this includes several GNOME packages and the libspe.  This last one is fairly "interesting" because the user documentation for it is high-quality, but all the credibility slips away when you look at the source code packaging...To all those authors:“Programs should be written and polished until they acquire publication quality.” &mdash; Niklaus Wirth

        The automated testing framework I'm working on is a project idea that has been around for a very long time.  Back in SoC 2005, this project was selected but, unfortunately, it was not developed.  A that time, the project was named regress, a name that was derived from the current name used in the NetBSD's source tree to group all available tests: the src/regress directory.In my opinion, the "regress" name was not very adequate because regression tests are just a kind of all possible tests: those that detect whether a feature that was supposed to be working has started to malfunction.  There are other kinds of tests, such as unit tests, integration tests and stress tests, all of which seemed to be excluded from the project just because of its name.When I wrote my project proposal this year, I tried to avoid the "regression testing" name wherever possible and, instead, simply used the "testing" word to emphasize that the project was not focusing on any specific test type.  Based on that, the NetBSD-SoC administrators chose the atf name for my project, which stands for Automated Testing Framework.  This is a very simple name,and, even though it cannot be easily pronounced, I don't dislike it: it is short, feels serious and clearly represents what the project is about.And for the sake of completion, let me mention another idea I had for the project's name.  Back when I proposed it, I thought it could be named "NetBSD Automated Testing Framework", which could then be shortened to nbatf or natf (very similar to the current name, eh?).  Based on the latter name, I thought... the "f" makes it hard to pronounce, so it'd be reduced to "nat", and then, it could be translated to the obvious (to me) person name that derives from it: Natalie.  That name stuck on my head for a short while, but it doesn't look too serious for a project name I guess ;-)  But now, as the atf won't be tied to NetBSD, that doesn't make much sense anyway.

      <p>
        This weekend I have finally been able to start coding for my SoC project: the Automated Testing Framework for NetBSD.  To my disliking, this has been delayed too much... but I was so busy with my PFC that I couldn't find any other chance to get my hands on it.I've started by working on two core components:libatf: The C/C++ library that will provide the interface to easily write test cases and test suites.  Among its features will be the ability to report the results of each test, a way to define meta-data for each test, etc.libatfmain: A library that provides a default entry point for test programs that takes care to run the test cases in a controlled environment &mdash; e.g. it captures all signals and deals with them gracefully &mdash; and provides a standard command-line interface for them.Soon after I started coding, I realized that I could need to write my own C code to deal with data collections and safe strings.  I hate that, because that's a very boring task &mdash; it is not related to the problem at hand at all &mdash; and because it involves reinventing the wheel: virtually all other languages provide these two features for-free.  But wait!  NetBSD has a C++ compiler, and atf won't be a host tool1.  So... I can take advantage of C++, and I'll try to.  Calm down!  I'll try to avoid some of the "complex" C++ features as much as possible to keep the executables' size small enough.  You know how the binaries' size blows up when using templates...  Oh, and by the way: keep in mind that test cases will be typically written in POSIX shell script, so in general you won't need to deal with the C++ interface.Furthermore, I see no reason for atf to be tied to NetBSD.   The test cases will surely be, but the framework needn't.  Thus I'm thinking of creating a standalone package for atf itself and distributing it as a completely independent project (under the TNF2 umbrella), which will later be imported into the NetBSD source tree as we currently do for other third-party projects such as Postfix.  In fact, I've already started work on this direction by creating the typical infrastructure to use the GNU auto-tools.  Of course this separation could always be done at a later step in the development, but doing it from the very beginning ensures the code is free of NetBSD-isms, emphasizes the portability desire and keeps the framework self-contained.I'd like to hear your comments about these "decisions" :-)1 A host tool is a utility that is built with the operating system's native tools instead of with the NetBSD's tool-chain: i.e. host tools are what build.sh tools builds.  Such tools need to be highly portable because they have to be accepted by old compilers and bizarre build environments.2 TNF = The NetBSD Foundation.

        A friend has just told me about Ohloh, a web site that analyzes the activity of open source projects by scanning their source repositories.  It is quite nice!  It generates statistics about the recent activity of each registered project, the languages they uses, the people working on them... And, for each developer, it accumulates statistics about their work on the different projects he has contributed to, automatically building a developer profile.You can add your own projects to the site, which is a very easy procedure, and create an account to have your own profile, which is useful to merge all your contributions to various projects into a single person.  I.e. if you have contributed to one of the registered projects and search for yourself, the web will return some hits; if you have an account, you can claim that you are that person and link your contributions to multiple projects into a single page.Check out my account for an example :-)Edit (19:20): Added the detailed widget.
