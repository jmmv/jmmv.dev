Be careful to not get lost.</p><hr><p><strong><a href=https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/01/05/building-red-hat-enterprise-linux-9-for-the-x86-64-v2-microarchitecture-level#>&ldquo;Building Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for the x86-64-v2 microarchitecture level&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>By Florian Weimer on January 5th, 2021</em></p><p>The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39250609">Hacker News thread</a> discussing the <a href=https://www.gentoo.org/news/2024/02/04/x86-64-v3.html>&ldquo;Gentoo x86-64-v3 binary packages available&rdquo;</a> article made me wonder what exactly the <code>v3</code> suffix after the <code>x86-64</code> architecture name was about. Fortunately, a helpful reply from <code>dtech</code> pointed to this other article that explains where these version suffixes came from.</p><hr><p><strong><a href=https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-berkley-software-distribution>&ldquo;The Berkley Software Distribution&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>By Bradford Morgan White on February 4th, 2024</em></p><p>Unix has a long story and, if you are interested in it at all, this is a great piece describing how BSD came to be. Most of the text is focused on the pre-FreeBSD and pre-NetBSD days though, so we are talking about some really old history here!</p><hr><p><strong><a href=/2024/02/beyond-the-1-mb-barrier-in-dos.html>&ldquo;Beyond the 1 MB barrier in DOS&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>By yours truly on February 7th, 2024</em></p><p>Last month, I gave you a detailed explanation of how DOS applications pulled <a href=/2024/01/from-0-to-1-mb-in-dos.html>all sorts of tricks</a> to maximize the usage of the first MB of the 80286+ address space. In this one, I continue the exploration to see how some DOS apps (particularly games) broke free from those limitations and moved into external memory.</p><p>For a richer discussion, you can see the coverage in <a href=https://www.osnews.com/story/138541/beyond-the-1-mb-barrier-in-dos/>OSNews</a> and <a href=https://hackaday.com/2024/02/09/breaking-through-the-1-mb-barrier-in-dos-with-unreal-mode-and-more/>Hackaday</a> among the other usual places. That said, it looks like I pretty much drained the pool of people interested in this topic: the discussions are pretty quiet on this second post and the number of subscribers to Blog System/5 got a bump, but a small one.</p><hr><p><strong><a href=https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/>"(Almost) Every infrastructure decision I endorse or regret after 4 years running infrastructure at a startup"</a></strong><br><em>By Jack Lindamood on February 1st, 2024</em></p><p>Good reflections on the technical decisions made at a start up and how they turned up after four years. We need more of these sorts of introspective posts: many times, people in tech make decisions, stick around for a year or two, and then leave for <del>greener pastures</del> higher comp without witnessing the impact that their choices had long-term. I&rsquo;ve seen this play out repeatedly and&mldr; I&rsquo;m probably at fault too.</p><hr><p><strong><a href=https://spectrum.ieee.org/lean-software-development>&ldquo;A 2024 plea for lean software&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>By Bert Hubert on February 8th, 2024</em></p><p>It is easy to dunk on the bloat of modern software&mdash;and you <em>should</em> dunk on it because the current state of affairs is <em>terrible</em>&mdash;but this article takes an interesting look at the problem by focusing on security. Or, rather, lack thereof&mldr; because the massive amounts of code we have to run even for the simplest tasks leave us open to unpredictable security holes.</p><hr><p><strong><a href=https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2024/02/12/fosdem-2024/>&ldquo;FOSDEM 2024: my experience, some notes and tech tips&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>By Herman Õunapuu on February 12th, 2024</em></p><p>Very detailed trip report to FOSDEM from a first timer. It&rsquo;s really long but it&rsquo;ll make you feel like you missed out for not going. A lot of the advice in it <a href=/2020/02/fosdem-navigation-101.html>matches what I wrote</a> back in 2020 during my first (and only so far) time there as well.</p><hr><p><strong><a href=https://chimera-linux.org/>&ldquo;Chimera Linux&rdquo;</a></strong><br></p><p>This Linux distribution sounds very appealing because it is very non-conformant&mdash;no glibc, GCC nor systemd&mdash;and leverages core system components from FreeBSD. A tweet from @unixterminal shows <a href=https://twitter.com/unixterminal/status/1756782019663606070>how to set it up under WSL</a>, which means it&rsquo;s super-easy to test-run it if you happen to be on Windows. I haven&rsquo;t tried yet, but if you have some time, there goes an idea.</p><hr><p><strong><a href=https://antithesis.com/blog/is_something_bugging_you/>&ldquo;Is something bugging you?&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>By Will Wilson on February 13th, 2024</em></p><p>I&rsquo;m a believer in automated and comprehensive testing. I often hear that you should <em>not</em> write tests for short-lived projects or during quick initial growth&mdash;and I think such advice is just plain wrong. Tests <em>do</em> slow you down at the very beginning of a greenfield project, but they pay dividends after just two weeks of full-time coding.</p><p>This article describes how the creators of FoundationDB reached the same conclusion because they developed and leveraged a solid infrastructure to run their software in a reproducible manner. They, in turn, turned this idea into a product&mdash;which means that the article is an ad, but it won&rsquo;t feel like it. Promise.</p><hr><p><strong><a href=https://blog.jgc.org/2024/02/the-original-www-proposal-is-word-for.html>&ldquo;The original WWW proposal is a Word for Macintosh 4.0 file from 1990, can we open it?&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>By John Graham-Cumming on February 13th, 2024</em></p><p>An interesting story in trying to open an old document from 1990 and render it in its original format. Contemporary tools like LibreOffice or Word are still able to open it, but they don&rsquo;t load diagrams properly.</p><p>This is why I <a href=/2016/01/medium-experiment-wrapup.html>made the choice</a> a long time ago to avoid Blogger and Medium and, even if you are now reading this in Substack, why I still author the originals in Markdown and store them in a Git repository.</p><hr><p><strong><a href=/2024/02/djgpp.html>&ldquo;Running GNU on DOS with DJGPP&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>By yours truly on February 14th, 2024</em></p><p>Following up on the earlier two articles describing how DOS apps managed memory and dealt with the limitations of real mode, I was finally able to write about how DJGPP achieves those goals <em>and also</em> makes GNU programs run on DOS. If you picture DJGPP as the &ldquo;WSL for DOS&rdquo;&mldr; you aren&rsquo;t too far off. Mind you, the article will show you bash running on DOS, but the content is primarily about the internals on how DJ achieved such feat.</p><hr><p><strong><a href=https://github.com/Speykious/cve-rs>&ldquo;cve-rs: Blazingly 🔥 fast 🚀 memory vulnerabilities, written in 100% safe Rust&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>By Speykious on February 15th, 2024</em></p><p>Big news everyone! Rust is finally able to replace C and C++ because, thanks to this little library, you can now implement memory vulnerabilities too! Don&rsquo;t miss out on the new GLWTSPL license either, which you&rsquo;ll have to assess for compatibility with your own before you can incorporate the code.</p><hr><p><strong><a href=/2024/02/to-c-or-not-to-c.html>&ldquo;To C or not to C&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>By yours truly on February 21st, 2024</em></p><p>An article disguised as a Twitter thread where I joined the ongoing <del>discussion</del> argument in the platform on whether knowing C is a prerequisite for being called a &ldquo;good programmer&rdquo;. Spoiler alert: it is <em>not</em>, but what C teaches you is very useful no matter what language you use.</p><hr><p><strong><a href=https://twitter.com/awesomekling/status/1761305126604550496>&ldquo;Ladybird browser can load VSCode&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>By Andreas Kling on February 24th, 2024</em></p><p>This is not an article but a mere comment from Andreas showing how the <a href=https://ladybird.dev/>Ladybird</a> browser, a from-scratch implementation of the web, can now load VSCode. Most of it doesn&rsquo;t work, but some does.</p><p>The reason I find this interesting is that it shows how much a small group of motivated developers can achieve in a short amount of time. &ldquo;Nobody&rdquo; believed that it was possible to implement a modern web browser from scratch in this day and age&mldr; and Ladybird is proving that wrong. Back in my time in the Bazel team, I always said that Bazel&rsquo;s demise would be a motivated grad student with lots of free time creating a truly open and small build system written in a systems language. The reason I believe this is possible is because I almost had that going on years before Bazel even existed&mldr; but I lacked the expertise to push it forward. Check out <a href=/2022/05/remembering-buildtool.html>the Buildtool rememberance article</a> for context.</p><hr><p><strong><a href=https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/the-january-february-2024-issue-of-the-freebsd-journal-is-here/>&ldquo;The January/February 2024 Issue of the FreeBSD Journal is Here!&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>On February 28th, 2024</em></p><p>This is fresh off the press so I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to read through it yet (other than for the opening Foundation Letter). However, I still hold FreeBSD and NetBSD close to my heart and felt that this deserves a shout out. In particular because the content is now free and they dropped that weird web/mobile app they were using in favor of publishing directly as HTML and PDF.</p><p>Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll have time to go back to contributing to the BSDs&mldr; but I do have some exciting news coming up about ATF and Kyua. Stay tuned.</p><h1 id=parting-words>Parting words</h1><p>And that&rsquo;s all for this month. I know the list is shorter this time around, in part because the noise around AI has eclipsed everything else and in part because I do want to focus on other projects. I&rsquo;m happy to have picked up EndBASIC again and some goodies are coming up soon:</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>One last demo before I throw all the prototype console code away and rewrite it “correctly”.
