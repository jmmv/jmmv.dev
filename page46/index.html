        Been tracking and resolving a bug in Linux's SPU scheduler for the last three days, and fixed it just a moment ago!  I'm happy and needed to mention this ;-)More specifically, tracking it down was fairly easy using SystemTap and Paraver (getting the two to play well together was another source of headaches), but fixing it was the most complex thing due to deadlocks popping up over and over again.  Sorry, can't disclose more information about it yet; want to think a bit more how to make this public and whether my fix is really OK or not.  But be sure I will!

        I started this week's work with the idea of instrumenting the spufs module found in Linux/Cell to be able to take some traces of the execution of Cell applications.  At first, I modified that module to emit events at certain key points, which were later registered in a circular queue.  Then, I implemented a file in /proc so that a user-space application could read from it and free space from the queue to prevent the loss of events when it was full.That first implementation never worked well, but as I liked how it was evolving, I thought it could be a neat idea to make this "framework" more generic so that other parts of the kernel could use it.  I rewrote everything with this idea in mind and then also modified the regular scheduler and the process-management system calls to also rise events for my trace.  And got it working.But then, I was talking to Brainstorm about his new "Sun Campus Ambassador" position at the University, and during the conversation he mentioned DTrace.  So I asked... "Mmm, that tool could probably simplify all my work; is it there something similar for Linux?".  And yes; yes it is!  Its name, SystemTap.As the web page says, SystemTap "provides an infrastructure to      simplify the gathering of information about the running Linux         system". You do this by writing small scripts that hook into specific points of the kernel — at the function level, at specific mark points, etc. — and which get executed when the script is processed and installed into the live kernel as a loadable kernel module.With this tool I can discard my several-hundred-long changes to gather traces and replace them with some very, very simple SystemTap scripts.  No need to rebuild the kernel, no need to deal with custom changes to it, no need to rebuild every now and then... neat!Now I'm having problems using the feature that allows to instrument kernel markers, and I need them because otherwise some private functions cannot be instrumented due to compiler optimizations (I think).  OK, I'd expose those functions, but while I'm at it, I think it'd be a good idea to write a decent tapset for spufs that could later be published.  And that prevents me from doing such hacks.But anyway, kudos to the SystemTap developers.  I now understand why everybody is so excited about DTrace.

        I've had my MacBoook Pro for a bit over than 11 months.  Not so long ago, I remember that the battery lasted for more than three and a half hours when using the machine very lightly (some web browsing or some e-mail reading, for example), and for a bit over an hour with (very) heavy usage.  But recently, I started to notice that its capacity had shortened to alarming levels: it now only lasted for about an hour with the machine idle!  That didn't feel right for a machine that only had a year of life.After installing coconutBattery, I was scared to see that the battery only had 53% of its original capacity, and that was after a modest number of 80 full charge cycles.  Compared to several other similar machines with much higher cycles count and battery life, mine was in very bad condition.I don't know if that was due to a defective battery or misuse of it (like too much heat caused by the computer damaging it), but I'm inclined to think it's the former specially because I've read similar (well, worse) problems from people that bought this same machine around the same dates.Anyway, the thing is I went to an Apple Store on monday to explain the situation: they just took the battery, noted down the machine's serial number (no need to show the invoice!) and told me that they'd send me an SMS when they had resolved the problem.  And... today... I received that message.  Shiny new battery and no complaints from them!  Kudos to the service, again.

        I'm decided to improve my knowledge on the Cell platform, and the best way to get started seems to be to learn 64-bit PowerPC assembly given that the PPU uses this instruction set.  Learning this will open the door to do some more interesting tricks with the architecture's low-level details.There are some excellent articles at IBM developerWorks dealing with this subject, and thanks to the first one in an introductory series to PPC64 I've been able to write the typical hello world program :-)Without further ado, here is the code!## The program's static data#.datamsg:    .string "Hello, world!n"        length = . - msg## Special section needed by the linker due to the C calling# conventions in this platform.#.section ".opd", "aw"               # aw = allocatable/writable.global _start_start:        .quad ._start, .TOC.@tocbase, 0## The program's code#.text._start:        li      0, 4                # write(2)        li      3, 1                # stdout file descriptor        lis     4, msg@highest      # load 64-bit buffer address        ori     4, 4, msg@higher        rldicr  4, 4, 32, 31        oris    4, 4, msg@h        ori     4, 4, msg@l        li      5, length           # buffer length        sc        li      0, 1                # _exit(2)        li      3, 0                # return success        scYou can build it with the following commands:$ as -a64 -o hello.o hello.s$ ld -melf64ppc -o hello hello.oI'm curious about as(1)'s -a option; its purpose is pretty obvious, but it is not documented anywhere in the manual page nor in the info files.Anyway, back to coding!  I guess I'll post more about this subject if I find interesting and/or non-obvious things that are not already documented clearly anywhere.  But for beginner's stuff you already have the articles linked above.

      <p>
        I've been installing the Cell SDK 3.0 on two Fedora 8 systems at home &mdash; a PlayStation 3 and an old AMD box &mdash; and I cannot understand how someone (IBM and BSC) can publish such an utterly broken piece of crap and be proud of it.  Sorry, had to say it.  (If you are one of those who wrote the installer, please excuse me, but that's what I really think.  Take this as a constructive criticism.)Before saying that Fedora 8 is not supported and that I should only run this on Fedora 7, shut up.  I am sure all the problems are there too, because none of them can be related to the system version.Strictly speaking, it is not that the installer does not work, because if you follow the instructions it does.  But it is a very strange program that leaves garbage all around your system, produces warning messages during execution and the garbage left around will keep producing warnings indefinitely.  Plus, to make things worse, the network connection to the BSC &mdash; where the free software packages are downloaded from by yum &mdash; is extremely unreliable from outside the university's direct connection (that is, from home), which means that you will have to retry the installation lots of times until you are able to download all the huge packages.  (In fact, that's what annoys me most.)  And this is not a problem that happened today only; it also bit me half a year ago when installing the 2.1 version.Let's talk about the installer, that marvelous application.Starting with version 3, the SDK is composed of a RPM package called cell-install and two ISO images (Devel and Extras).  When I saw that, I was pretty happy because I thought that, with the RPM package alone, I'd be able to do all the installation without having to deal with ISO images.  It turns out that that is not true, as some components only seem to be available from within them (most likely the non-free ones, but I haven't paid attention).Ah, you want to know what the SDK contains.  Basically, it is composed of a free GCC-based toolchain for both the PPU and SPUs, the free run-time environment (the libspe2), a proprietary toolchain, the proprietary IBM SystemSim for Cell simulator and some other tools (a mixture of free and non-free ones).  So, as you can see, we have some free components and some proprietary ones.  You can, in fact, develop for the Cell architecture by using the free components alone.  So why on earth do you need the proprietary ones?  Why can't you skip them?  Why aren't they available in some nice repository that I can use without any external "installer" and avoid such crap?  That's something I don't get.  (Maybe it's possible with some extra effort, but not what the instructions tell you.)OK, back to the installer.  So you need to copy the two ISOs in a temporary directory, say /tmp/iso and then run the installer by doing something like:# cd /opt/cell# ./cellsdk --iso /tmp/dir installThis will first proceed to show you some license agreements. Here is one funny point: you must accept the GPL and LGPL terms.  Come on!  I am using Fedora, and I am already using lots of GPL'd components for which I did not see the license.  Why do I have to do that?  And why do I have to reaccept the IBM license terms when I already did that in the downloads page?After the license thing, it mounts the images under /tmp/sdk (keep this in mind because we'll get back to it later), probably does some black magic and at last launches yum groupinstall with multiple parameters to install all the SDK components.  All right, you accept the installation details and it starts installing stuff.  This would be OK if it wasn't for the network connection problems I mentioned earlier; I've had to restart this part dozens of times (literally) to be able to get all packages.  So, again, question: why couldn't you simply tell me what to put in yum's configuration, define some installation groups for the free components alone and let me use yum to install those without having to trust some foreign and crappy installer script?  Why do you insist on using /opt for some components and uninconsistently between architectures?And why did I mention /tmp/sdk?  Because the yum repositories registered by the installer have this location hardcoded in.  Once you unmount the ISO images (that is, when the installation is done), yum will keep complaining about missing files in /tmp/sdk forever &mdash; unless you manually change yum's configuration, that is.  What is nicer, though, is that yum always complains about one specific repository because it is only available online, yet it also looks for a corresponding image in /tmp/sdk.At last, there are also some random problems (probably caused by all the above inconsistencies).  Once, the script finalized successfully but the SDK was left half installed: some components were missing.  Another time, the installer hang in the middle (no CPU consuption at all, no system activity) when it seemed it had finished and had to manually kill it.  After restarting it, it effectively had not finished as it had to install some more stuff.Summarizing... all these problems may not be so important, but they make one feel that the whole SDK is a very clunky thing.I wish someone could create native packages for the free components of the SDK and import them into the official Fedora (or, please, please, please, Debian) repositories.  After all, these are just a native compiler for the PPU, a cross-compiler for the SPUs, the libspe2 and the SPU's newlib.  Note that the GCC backends for both the PPU and SPUs are already part of the FSF trees, so it shouldn't be too difficult to achieve by using official, nicer sources.Rant time over.

        Today's work: been fixing NetBSD's id(1)'s command line parsing to match the documented syntax.  Let's explain.Yesterday, for some unknown reason, I ended up running id(1) with two different user names as its arguments. Mysteriously, I only got the details for the first user back and no error for the second one. After looking at the manual page and what the GNU implementation did, I realized that the command is only supposed to take a single user or none at all as part of its arguments.OK, so "let's add a simple argc check to the code and raise the appropriate error when it is greater than 2".  Yeah, right.  If you look at id(1)'s main routine, you'll find an undecipherable piece of spaghetti code &mdash; have you ever thought about adding multiple ?flag variables and checking the result of the sum? &mdash; that comes from the fact that id(1)'s code is shared across three different programs: id(1), groups(1) and whoami(1).After spending some time trying to understand the rationale behind the code, I concluded that I could not safely fix the problem as easily as I first thought.  And, most likely, touching the logic in there would most likely result in a regression somewhere else, basically because id(1) has multiple primary, mutually-exclusive options and groups(1) and whoami(1) are supposed to have their own syntax.  Same unsafety as for refactoring it.So what did I do?  Thanks to ATF being already in NetBSD, I spent the day writing tests for all possible usages of the three commands (which was not trivial at all) and, of course, added stronger tests to ensure that the documented command line syntax was enforced by the programs.  After that, I was fairly confident that if I changed the code and all the new tests passed afterwards (specially those that did before), I had not broken it.  So I did the change only after the tests were done.I know it will be hard to "impose" such testing/bug-fixing procedure to other developers, but I would really like them to consider extensive testing... even for obvious changes or for trivial tools such as these ones. You never know when you break something until someone else complains later.

        Finally!  After more than five months of development (with different intensities of work), I am very pleased to announce that ATF, my Google Summer of Code 2007 project, has been integrated into the NetBSD source tree.For more details see the official announcement in the tech-userlevel@ mailing list.
