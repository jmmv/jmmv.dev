      <article>
        Some days ago I was "forced" to remove all packages in my workstation due to massive revision bumps in pkgsrc.  Since I had to install an environment for X, I decided to give <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> 3.5.1 a try.<br /><br />The thing is that I hadn't used KDE seriously since I switched to GNOME 2.6 (ouch, that was two years ago... time passes really fast).  Of course I installed it several times in this period and tried to use it, but I stopped the evaluation after a 5-minute ride.  I didn't feel comfortable because I wasn't used to it and, to make things "worse", I could quickly escape to GNOME as it was installed alongside it, ready to be used again.<br /><br />But... you know what?  I'm discovering some impressive things in KDE.  Overall, I like it <i>very</i> much, up to the point of maybe not switching back (with the exception of Mac OS X on the laptop, that is.)  Let's see some of the things I've "discovered":<ul><br /><li>The audiocd kioslave: kioslaves are extensions for KDE's IO library, much like the methods for gnome-vfs.  KDE has kioslaves for everything, but the audiocd one is impressive: it represents an audio CD as a virtual set of files in different formats, being OGG and MP3 among them.  These files either represent a single track or the whole CD.  Their names are guessed using the CDDB database.  And you guessed right: ripping and encoding a CD is as easy as dragging and dropping those virtual files wherever you want!</li><li>File properties: Right clicking on a file and choosing properties shows the standard settings tabs, but also shows some that are specific to that file type.  I found this useful to correct the tags in the OGG files I had ripped.  (I don't know if GNOME currently has this; couldn't tell for sure.)</li><li>Consistency: Many typical options are in common places, no matter the application you are in.  All common keybindings can be configured in a central place so that they affect all programs.  OK, I know many GNOME utilities also have this integration in but this had to be mentioned.</li><li><a href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a>: I wish it could use Gecko as its rendering widget (I think it can, but don't know how) because, unfortunately, KHTML fails to render correctly some pages I visit often.  Anyway, it makes an excellent browser and a handy file manager.  Its address bar supports many shortcuts to quickly access several search systems.</li><li><a href="http://www.k3b.org/">K3B</a>: At last, a decent CD and DVD burner for Unix systems.  I know it has been around for a long while but it didn't work under NetBSD until very recently, so I couldn't use it.</li><li><a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a>: Neat music player.  It's visually attractive and easy to manage.  I like the way it can be globally controlled with keybindings and how simple it is to fetch lyrics.</li><li><a href="http://www.digikam.org/">Digikam</a>: Good picture manager.  Despite I tried an outdated version (0.7.0), it is still quite nice.  Haven't had time to analyze it in detail yet, though.</li><li>Almost everything works.  Kudos to Mark Davies (markd@) for his excellent work in porting KDE to NetBSD.</li></ul>As a drawback, I still find KDE's interface too cluttered for my tastes.  But I think I can live with this, specially because the interface can be simplified with some tuning effort.  Not to mention that KDE 4 promises to be focused on usability... really looking forward to it!
