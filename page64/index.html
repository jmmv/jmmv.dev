        Quicksilver is, at a first glance, an application launcher for OS X.  It lets you search for and quickly launch your applications using predictive lookups.  You invoke the application with a keybinding of your choice, type in the first letters of the program you want to launch (as much as it takes to locate it) and hit return.  If you have ever used Spotlight, you know what I mean.Even though, Quicksilver is much more than a program launcher.  It lets you control the active application or look for files in your machine, making it possible to apply many actions to them with few key presses (again, predictive lookups).  For example, you'd copy the Application form.txt file stored in your Documents folder straight to the pen drive you just connected by using as few as 7 key presses.  It may sound a lot, but if you get used to it, it is a really quick way to work.But wait!  There is much more to it.  Quicksilver can be extended by means of plugins.  They integrate with other applications such as iTunes, bringing you the ability to "remotely" control them from the keyboard.  (For this specific case, I still prefer SizzlingKeys.)This utility is specially useful when you are working at the keyboard and do not want to move your hands away to reach the mouse.  Of course, you first need to get efficient with it to really appreciate its power.  I have only been using it for a few days, but it certainly improves productivity in some situations.You may want to read this introduction or this intermediate guide by Dan Dickinson in case you try it out.Pity it takes so long to start on my iBook...

      <p>
        So... past Saturday (June 2nd), I ran to the closest store and bought Half-Life 2: Episode One, the continuation to Half-Life 2.   As you may already know from my Half-Life 2 "review", I am a big fan of this title so I was dying to play EP1.  (I know, I know... I still have a lot of work to do  e.g. SoC  but I had to relax a bit.)A lot has been said about this game already, but I wanted to give my own opinion.  And what a better place than this.  Overall, the game deserves a good score.  If you liked HL2, you will certainly enjoy this one because it is more of the same old and well-known things.  At first, it feels a bit slow because there are lots of dialogues, not to mention that you go unarmed (except for the gravity gun).  This is because the game starts exactly where HL2 ended.  Afterward, you get your weapons again and it becomes as active as you'd expect.If you are wondering why I am posting this now, it is I just finished the game today.  If I have to say something negative about it is that EP1 feels too short.  Its play time is estimated to be around five hours; I surely spent some more, but it still ended too quickly.  HL2 was a bit more than twice the price, but it was much, much longer.  If EP2 and EP3 are as "short" as this one, they'd benefit from a cheaper price.And until EP2 comes out (will be a long wait...), I will go through EP1 again with the developers' comments enabled to see what I missed :-)  Pity my machine is not powerful enough to enable HDR and other quality effects in Source.

        This semester, I was assigned a task that was meant to practice the knowledge gathered about the functional programming paradigm during a CS course.  The task was to develop an abstract data type for a processes network and a way to automatically convert it to Miranda executable code.A processes network is an idea based on the data flow paradigm: a network is a set of processes that cooperate together to reach a result.  A process is an entity that produces a single output based on a set of inputs, which can be other processes or parameters fed in by the user (think of a shell pipeline).  The process itself is modeled by a function, either defined in another network or provided by the language natively.  A program is then composed of a set of these networks.  Functional languages are ideal to implement a program modeled using this paradigm.Our program could be written either in Miranda (the language taught in class) or Haskell.  My partner and I decided to go for the latter because it is a live language (Miranda seems dead), it is free and there is much more information for it than for the former.  The drawback was that we were on our own learning it and it was really tough to get started, but it has been a very rewarding experience.But why is functional programming so interesting?  It is a paradigm where the sole basis of execution is the evaluation of expressions.  These expressions are composed of functions (either native ones or defined by the user), so the programmer's task is to write new functions and compose them to achieve the correct data transformation.  There is no notion of memory nor variables as in imperative languages.  And in Haskell's case, everything just feels correct; if something is not well understood or does not fit the paradigm, it is not included in the language.Here are some of the key items to functional programming; some of them may be Haskell-specific:Functions have no side effects: there are no global variables.There are no loops: algorithms have to be thought in recursive terms.  Although this may seem difficult at first, it is not so much thanks to the built-in functions.Everything has a mathematical background, which makes formal proofing easier than with imperative languages.  For example, one can define an abstract data type based exclusively on its formal construction equations: in the stack's case, it'd be defined by means of an empty constructor and a "push" one.High-order functions:  ever thought to pass a function as a parameter to another one?  C++ has some kind of support for this through predicates, but in a functional language this idea is the key to success: it is used extensively and is much more powerful.Lazy evaluation: a neat idea.  It makes the treatment of infinite or undefined objects possible.  This concept is not generic to the paradigm but is commonly associated with it.Strong typed: Haskell is very strong typed but it does not require you to manually specify types (although you can); isn't it strange?  The compiler/interpreter comes with a powerful type deduction system that does the work for you and ensures everything makes sense, type-wise speaking.So far I like the language and the paradigm very much, and I have only grasped their surface.  There are tons of things I still do not know how to do, not to mention that it is quite hard to avoid imperative programming thinking.  I'm thinking to use Haskell to write at least one of my personal projects to really experience its power.If you have some spare time and are willing to learn something new, give functional programming languages — hmm, Haskell — a try.  Just get the Hugs interpreter, the Haskell tutorial and get started! I bet you'll like it ;-)

        After some days of delay, Google has published the final list of chosen projects for this year's Summer of Code; it consists of 630 funded projects.  If you browse through them, you will find lots of interesting things.  The good thing is that most of them will be worked on seriously, so there will be great contributions by the end of the summer :-)As I told you, my project is listed under the Boost page alongside other interesting projects.  It looks like Boost will get a lot of new work — and contributors — this summer.  At least, this is the case for me: I am not very involved with Boost development yet.Also take a look at the NetBSD-SoC page, which lists all projects chosen by NetBSD.  At first I was sorry to abandon my slot in favour of the Boost one.  But now that I have seen the project that took it, I am happy; it is something really needed.  I won't tell you which it is because all of them are equally interesting! ;-)

        I am very proud to annouce that I have been accepted into Google's Summer of Code program &mdash; again!  During Summer 2005 I developed an efficient, memory-based file system for the NetBSD operating system, baptized tmpfs.  I must confess that I enjoyed very much hacking the NetBSD kernel and also learned a lot about file systems.So this year I was eager to repeat the experience by taking part in SoC again.  In order to ensure my participation, I thoroughly prepared three applications for three different projects.  I had a hard time making the choices because there were tons of interesting projects (which could have taught me very different skills), but at last decided for the following:Application 1: Add complete NetBSD support to GRUB 2.  I chose this project because I knew I could do it, but mostly because I wanted to ensure that GRUB 2 had first-class support for BSD operating systems.  GRUB currently lacks features to correctly boot these, which is a nuisance.  After sending the application, I was quickly contacted by a GRUB developer telling me that there was another student willing to work on this project, and that he did not knew what to do.  I offered to leave my spot to the other developer, hoping to capture another potential NetBSD hacker.Application 2: Develop a process management library for Boost.  This is something I have had in mind since February 2005, when I first discovered Boost.  I was planning to do this as my final computer science degree next Spring, but applied for it now so that I could free myself from this idea.  (I have other projects in mind that are currently blocked by the lack of Boost.Process.)Application 3: Improve NetBSD's regression testing framework.  After looking at the list of suggested projects for NetBSD and evaluating them, I felt that working on this area could have been very useful for the project, improving its overall quality; I like and enjoy writing software that is able to test itself as much as possible.The decision between the Boost and NetBSD projects was quite hard to make, so I opted to send both in and let luck decide.  Strictly speaking, I stated in my applications that I preferred to do the Boost project for several reasons and I guess Google made their choice based on that.  But do not get me wrong: I enjoyed very much the time I spent hacking NetBSD, and I hope to continue doing so in the near future.Summarizing: I will be developing the Boost.Process library this summer!  See the links above for more some information: the wiki page holds some ideas about its design and the application lists my reasons to want to work on this.I now feel sorry for not "being able" to work on NetBSD's regression testing framework.  I do not know if anybody else has been picked to work on it, but if not, this project seems doomed...  It was choosen past year but the student abandoned it half-way.  This year it was also choosen by NetBSD but Google preferred me to work on Boost.  However... while writing the application, my interest in this project raised, which means that I may retake it in the future if nobody else does; maybe as my CS final degree project? :-)Now... stay tuned for further news on Boost.Process!

        A bit more than a week ago we had to experiment with Nessus as part of a class assignment. Nessus is a very complete vulnerability scanner that runs on top of Unix-based operating systems.  In order to not get obsolete too quickly, the set of checks it runs can be updated based on a database maintained by the product's company, Tenable (much like what happens with an antivirus utility).  It is important to note that this list is always seven days behind the up-to-date list unless you are a paid subscriber, which is very reasonable.I liked how it worked and decided to try it at home to analyze my machines, so I went and downloaded the beta version for Mac OS X (I didn't want to fiddle with manual setup in other OSes...).  After installation, it asked me for my activation code (sent by mail) and proceeded to download the most up-to-date vulnerability list (free version).  At that point, it was possible to start the server part.When launching the client I was presented with a neat, native Mac OS X interface.  Analyzing the whole home network was trivial and the results were impressive.  Despite that it raised some false positives (depending on the configured paranoia level), it told me several things that were sensible and listed pointers to external information (CVE entries, knowledge base articles, etc.) that was helpful to solve them.If you are a network administrator, I bet this utility was already known to you but it came as new to me very recently and liked it.

        If you need to maintain multiple hosts, you know how boring it is to repeat the exact same task on all of them. I'm currently using PlanetLab as part of a class assignment and I'm facing this problem because I need to set up around 10 machines and execute the same commands on all of them.vxargs is a nice Python script that eases this task. It lets you run a command parametrizing it with a given set of strings (e.g. host names), similar to what find's -exec flag does. First of all, you construct a file with the list of host names you need to control and then feed it to the script alongside the command you need to execute. For example, to upload a dist.tgz file to all the servers:vxargs -a hosts.list -o /tmp/result scp dist.tgz {}:The utility will replace the {} substring with each line in hosts.list and will execute the command. The nice thing is that vxargs runs all tasks in parallel, maximizing efficience. During execution, its cursed-based interface shows the progress of each command. And when all jobs are over, you will find their output (stdout and stderr) as well as their exit code in the /tmp/result directory. Fairly useful.Despite that manually installing vxargs is easy, there is now a vxargs package in pkgsrc.
