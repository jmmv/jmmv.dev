      <description>I&#39;ve been told today about the Piled Higher and Deeper website, also known as phdcomics (easier to remember). And so far I&#39;m hooked. I love this comic strip! May it be because I&#39;m already involved in the research area due to my PFC and I know what they are talking about? Possibly. And it also illustrates what I can &#34;expect&#34; if I finally enroll in a Ph.D. course. </description>
