I&amp;rsquo;ve been drive-testing it for a few months and have been quite pleased with it, so here go my impressions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="how-did-i-get-here">How did I get here?&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s backtrack a bit first. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Vim and Emacs user for many years. Yes, I use both &lt;em>regularly&lt;/em> depending on what I have to achieve. For me, Vim shines in doing quick single-file changes and repetitive edits through many files, while Emacs shines in long-lived coding sessions that involve numerous open buffers. These editors are well-suited to &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/my-coding-workflow.html">my remote-based coding workflow&lt;/a> because they run just fine in the terminal. However, sometimes I just &lt;em>would like to&lt;/em> take advantage of the desktop environment and the GUI of these two editors on OS X&amp;hellip; err.. sucks&amp;hellip; so I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to find something else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My coding workflow</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/my-coding-workflow.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2015 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/my-coding-workflow.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>How would you best organize your work environment for maximum productivity if you were tasked to develop a type of application you had never developed before?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if you could witness how an experienced developer manages the tools of the craft so that you could draw ideas and incorporate them into your own workflow?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>This post aims to answer the above for the type of work I do by sharing how my workflow looks like. I want to compel you to share your own story in the comments section, and by doing so, create a collection of stories so that others can benefit from them.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2015-09-08-header.png" length="1242379" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Get a handle on email subscriptions</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2015/06/get-a-handle-on-email-subscriptions.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2015 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2015/06/get-a-handle-on-email-subscriptions.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Do you have any idea which online services and stores have you given your email address to?

&lt;p>Three years ago, I was not able to answer these two simple questions when I decided to move my email account to our new family-owned domain. Today? I trivially can, and so can you.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2015-06-06-header.jpg" length="198194" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
