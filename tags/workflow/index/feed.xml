      <description>On April 14th, 2016, Microsoft announced the 1.0 release of their open-source Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor. I&amp;rsquo;ve been drive-testing it for a few months and have been quite pleased with it, so here go my impressions.
How did I get here? Let&amp;rsquo;s backtrack a bit first. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Vim and Emacs user for many years. Yes, I use both regularly depending on what I have to achieve. For me, Vim shines in doing quick single-file changes and repetitive edits through many files, while Emacs shines in long-lived coding sessions that involve numerous open buffers.</description>

      <title>My coding workflow</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you best organize your work environment for maximum productivity if you were tasked to develop a type of application you had never developed before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if you could witness how an experienced developer manages the tools of the craft so that you could draw ideas and incorporate them into your own workflow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This post aims to answer the above for the type of work I do by sharing how my workflow looks like. I want to compel you to share your own story in the comments section, and by doing so, create a collection of stories so that others can benefit from them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Do you have any idea which online services and stores have you given your email address to? Are you able to quantify the effort it would take to fully migrate to a different email account if you ever wanted to?

 Three years ago, I was not able to answer these two simple questions when I decided to move my email account to our new family-owned domain.</description>
