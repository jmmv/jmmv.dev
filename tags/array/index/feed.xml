      <description>This evening a friend asked me if I knew how to easily flatten an array of arrays (AoA from now on) in Perl 5. What that means is, basically, to construct a single array that contains the concatenation of all the arrays inside the AoA.
My first answer was: &#34;foldr&#34;, but I knew beforehand that he wouldn&#39;t like it because... this is Haskell. After some time we got to the conclusion that there is no trivial way to flatten an AoA in Perl 5, even though Perl 6 includes a built-in function to do so.</description>
