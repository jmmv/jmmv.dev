Being "free" hardware for testing I could not turn it down, but at first I honestly was not sure what to do with it: I already got a Nexus 10 last year and exchanged it soon after for a Nexus 7 because I did not did not like its bulky feeling.</description></item><item><title>One month in with Android Wear</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2015/02/one-month-in-with-android-wear.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2015 22:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2015/02/one-month-in-with-android-wear.html</guid><description>Or: A review of the LG G Watch.
Right before the Christmas holidays, I was gifted an LG G Watch Black Titan, a relatively simple smartwatch that sports the new Android Wear operating system:
After over a month of daily use, I am now comfortable about writing about my impressions. But, before doing that, let me set this review in the right context.
Context-setting Sometime last summer, the continuous interruptions from my phone ended up irritating me significantly.</description></item><item><title>Putting a PowerMac G5 to good use</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/07/putting-powermac-g5-to-good-use.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2013 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/07/putting-powermac-g5-to-good-use.html</guid><description>A few months ago I bought an old PowerMac G5 off of Craigslist and since then I have been experimenting with various operating systems and configurations. Before I tell you more about these, let me briefly explain why I got such a machine.

But last December I found a great offer on the MacBook Pro 15.4", being the total price similar to what I was planning to buy.
