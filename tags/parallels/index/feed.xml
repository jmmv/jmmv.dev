However, when Parallels 3 appeared, I hesitated to pre-order it (even at a very low price) and I did well: after it was released, I tried it on my MacBook Pro and their 3D support is useless for me. I could not play neither Half-Life 2 nor Doom 3 at acceptable speeds, being the former much worse than the latter in this regard.</description></item><item><title>Six months with the MacBook Pro</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/06/six-months-with-macbook-pro.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jun 2007 07:47:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/06/six-months-with-macbook-pro.html</guid><description>If memory serves well, today makes the sixth month since I have got my MacBook Pro and, during this period, have been using it as my sole computer. I feel it is a good time for another mini-review.
Well... to get started: this machine is great; I probably haven't been happier with any other computer before. I have been able to work on real stuff &amp;mdash; instead of maintaining the machine &amp;mdash; during these months without a hitch.</description></item><item><title>Cross-platform development with Parallels</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/04/cross-platform-development-with.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2007 10:35:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/04/cross-platform-development-with.html</guid><description>These days I'm seizing some of my free time to continue what I did as my SoC 2006 project: the Boost.Process library. There is still a lot of work to be done, but some items are annoying enough to require early attention (well, I can't speak of "early" because I hadn't touched the code for months).
Boost.Process aims to be a cross-platform library and currently works under POSIX-based systems (such as Linux, NetBSD or Mac OS X) as well as under Win32 systems.</description></item><item><title>X11 mode-line generator</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/03/x11-mode-line-generator.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2007 13:33:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/03/x11-mode-line-generator.html</guid><description>I recently installed NetBSD-current (4.99.12 at the time I did this) inside Parallels Desktop for Mac. Everything went fine except for the configuration of the XFree86 shipped with the base system: I was unable to get high resolutions to work (over 1024x768 if I recall correctly), and I wanted to configure a full-screen desktop. In my specific case, this is 1440x900, the MacBook Pro's native resolution.
It turns out I had to manually add a mode line to the XF86Config file to get that resolution detected.</description></item></channel></rss>
