My plan for these last few weeks was to hand things off as cleanly as possible&amp;hellip; but I was also nerd-sniped by a bug that came my way a fortnight ago. Fixing it has been my self-inflicted punishment for leaving, and oh my, it has been painful. Very painful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me tell you the story of this final boss.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bazel output streaming, Ctrl+C, and test flakiness</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/09/bazel-test-streaming-bug.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 07:10:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/09/bazel-test-streaming-bug.html</guid><description>&lt;p>About two weeks ago, I found a very interesting bug in Bazel&amp;rsquo;s test output streaming functionality while writing tests for a new feature related to Ctrl+C interrupts. I fixed the bug, wrote a test for it, and&amp;hellip; the test itself came back as flaky, which made me find another very subtle bug in the test that needed a one-line fix. This is the story of both.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Bazel has a feature known as &lt;strong>test output streaming&lt;/strong>: by default, Bazel captures the outputs (stdout and stderr) of the tests it runs, saves those in local log files, and tells the user where they are when a test fails. This is not very ergonomic when you are iterating on a test, so you can make Bazel print the output of the test as it runs by passing &lt;code>--test_output=streamed&lt;/code> to the invocation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bazel UI locking and file downloads</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/09/bazel-ui-locking.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 16:40:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/09/bazel-ui-locking.html</guid><description>&lt;p>About a month ago, I was benchmarking the impact of a new Bazel feature and I noticed that a test build that should have taken only a few seconds took almost 10 minutes. My Internet connection was flaking out indeed, but something else didn&amp;rsquo;t seem right. So I looked and found that Bazel was doing network calls within a critical section, and these were the root cause behind the massive slowdown. But how did we get such an obvious no-no into the codebase? Read on to see how this happened and how gnarly it was to fix!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
