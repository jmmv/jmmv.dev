      <description>As I already mentioned, I was interested in buying a 24&#34; widescreen monitor for both my laptop and PlayStation 3. I considered many different options but, based on my requirements (1920x1200, 1:1 pixel mapping, dual HDMI/DVI-D inputs), I ended up choosing the BenQ FP241W Z (yeah, did it again).
This thing is gorgeous as the following photos will show you. Lots of real screen state to work — the ability to have many different, non-overlapping editors and terminals open at once is very convenient — and great to watch videos.</description>

      <description>As promised in the previous post Choosing a 24&#34; widescreen monitor, here comes the brief analysis I did before deciding which monitor to buy. Refer to the comparison table (or the PDF version if the XHTML one does not work for you) for more details. I&#39;m linking this externally because putting it here, in this width-limited page, would be unsuitable.
The data in that table has been taken from the official vendor pages when possible, even though they failed to list some of the details.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m currently using a 17&#34; flat screen with the PlayStation 3 and, also, for my MacBook Pro in clamshell mode. For the laptop, it is &#34;reasonable&#34; given that it has a similar resolution to the one of the built-in screen, but for the PlayStation 3 it simply sucks: I can only use it through the composite input, which results in very bad graphics quality. I also miss the 20&#34; monitor I sold when I bought the MacBook Pro, which was very nice to watch videos and had lots of real screen state to work comfortably.</description>
