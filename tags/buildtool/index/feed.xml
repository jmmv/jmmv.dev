If I recall correctly, my interest in this area started when I got into NetBSD in 2002&amp;mdash;20 years ago&amp;mdash;and became a pkgsrc contributor. Packaging software for NetBSD made me &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2005/03/making-packager-friendly-software-1.html">fight various build systems&lt;/a> and, in particular, experience the pains of debugging the GNU Autotools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Around that same time, I was also writing &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/software/menu2wm.html">small&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/software/vcsme.html">tools&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/software/xmlcatmgr.html">here&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/software/sysbuild.html">and&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/software/pkg_comp.html">there&lt;/a>. Out of inertia, I used the GNU Autotools for these and, the more I used them, the more I saw an opportunity for improvement. The GNU Autotools were slow, hard to deal with, and they bloated every package. Why did you have to ship heavy &lt;code>configure&lt;/code>, &lt;code>Makefile.in&lt;/code> and &lt;code>libtool&lt;/code> scripts in every single distribution file when you could instead rely on a few system-wide scripts? And thus &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/software/buildtool.html">Buildtool&lt;/a> was born in the summer of 2002, just before I started college, and I worked on it for about two years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Buildtool project recently came to mind and I noticed that &lt;a href="http://buildtool.sourceforge.net/">its website is still up and running&lt;/a> (kudos to SourceForge for that), so I poked around a bit. Just by looking at the &lt;a href="http://buildtool.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/index.html">User&amp;rsquo;s Manual&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;m amazed by how comprehensive the tool is and makes me jealous of how much free time I had back then. Since noticing this, I had been meaning to try the tool again and write a post, and finally got to it just yesterday. So let&amp;rsquo;s take a tour of what Buildtool was and what it achieved.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Buildtool status</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2004/12/buildtool-status.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2004 10:49:00 -0500</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2004/12/buildtool-status.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Hmm, &lt;a href="http://buildtool.sourceforge.net/">Buildtool&lt;/a>... one of my pet projects, probably the one on which I've spent the most time working... and it was even starting to get some (few) popularity lately&lt;/p> &lt;p>But I must admit it. The code is, in its actual form, dead :-( It's unmanageable (shell scripting doesn't scale, you know) and breaks in many, many places. Just consider the following facts:&lt;/p> &lt;ul> &lt;li>Detection of C++ features from &lt;tt>bt_config&lt;/tt> fails in many cases.&lt;/li> &lt;li>&lt;tt>bt_logic&lt;/tt>'s behavior is less than acceptable, and adding functionality to it is a PITA.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Several modules haven't been modified across versions, so they don't work properly. For example, &lt;tt>bt_lint&lt;/tt> is almost useless.&lt;/li> &lt;li>Shared library handling is broken in many systems, and fixing it could be very difficult.&lt;/li> &lt;li>The code exposes internals too much, specially in environmental variables and C/C++ defines. But cleaning that up is also complex due to the nature of shell scripts.&lt;/li> &lt;li>I was suggested recently to make &lt;tt>bt_dist&lt;/tt> only include in tarballs what was really needed, and not everything (just like &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">GNU Automake&lt;/a>'s &lt;tt>make dist&lt;/tt> does. I like the suggestion, but implementing correctly is impossible due to the current code.&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;p>... plus a large etcetera. All in all, too many problems that can't be solved without doing very gross hacks or restarting the project from scratch. This is why I haven't touched the code since the beginning of the summer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Buildtool 0.16 released</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2004/07/buildtool-016-released.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2004 18:05:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2004/07/buildtool-016-released.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I'm proud to annouce the sixteenth version of &lt;a href="http://buildtool.sourceforge.net/">Buildtool&lt;/a> (0.16), the newest and coolest version ever published (hmm... this holds true for all new versions so far). Don't know what is it? Just go to the website and start reading!&lt;/p> &lt;p>This new version comes with lots of new features and bug fixes, developed during the previous five months. Yeah, I know... a very long delay since the previous version, but I haven't had enough time to sit down and publish a version; it's a very time consuming and error prone task. Without detailing it much, I've to: create the tarballs, upload them (to &lt;a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge&lt;/a>), create entries for the files, update the website to announce the new version, send an announcement to &lt;a href="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat&lt;/a>, update the NetBSD packages... and post to this blog (this step is new in this version, hehe).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
