If I recall correctly, my interest in this area started when I got into NetBSD in 2002&amp;mdash;20 years ago&amp;mdash;and became a pkgsrc contributor. Packaging software for NetBSD made me fight various build systems and, in particular, experience the pains of debugging of the GNU Autotools.
Around that same time, I was also writing small tools here and there. Out of inertia, I used the GNU Autotools for these and, the more I used them, the more I saw an opportunity for improvement.</description></item><item><title>Buildtool status</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2004/12/buildtool-status.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2004 10:49:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2004/12/buildtool-status.html</guid><description>Hmm, Buildtool... one of my pet projects, probably the one on which I've spent the most time working... and it was even starting to get some (few) popularity lately
But I must admit it. The code is, in its actual form, dead :-( It's unmanageable (shell scripting doesn't scale, you know) and breaks in many, many places. Just consider the following facts:
Detection of C++ features from bt_config fails in many cases.</description></item><item><title>Buildtool 0.16 released</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2004/07/buildtool-016-released.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2004 18:05:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2004/07/buildtool-016-released.html</guid><description>I'm proud to annouce the sixteenth version of Buildtool (0.16), the newest and coolest version ever published (hmm... this holds true for all new versions so far). Don't know what is it? Just go to the website and start reading!
This new version comes with lots of new features and bug fixes, developed during the previous five months. Yeah, I know... a very long delay since the previous version, but I haven't had enough time to sit down and publish a version; it's a very time consuming and error prone task.</description></item></channel></rss>
