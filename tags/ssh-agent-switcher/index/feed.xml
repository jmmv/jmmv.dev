In it, I described how SSH agent forwarding works&amp;mdash;a feature that lets a remote machine use the credentials stored in your local ssh-agent instance&amp;mdash;and how using a console multiplexer like tmux or screen often breaks it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that article, I presented the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jmmv/ssh-agent-switcher/">ssh-agent-switcher&lt;/a>: a program I put together in a few hours to fix this problem. In short, ssh-agent-switcher exposes an agent socket at a stable location (&lt;code>/tmp/ssh-agent.${USER?}&lt;/code> by default) and proxies all incoming credential requests to the transient socket that the sshd server creates on a connection basis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, I want to formalize this project by presenting its first actual release, 1.0.0, and explain what has changed to warrant this release number. I put effort into creating this formal release because ssh-agent-switcher has organically gained more interest than I imagined as it is solving a real problem that various people have.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SSH agent forwarding and tmux done right</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/ssh-agent-forwarding-and-tmux-done.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 08:50:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/ssh-agent-forwarding-and-tmux-done.html</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent">SSH agent&lt;/a> is a little daemon that holds your private keys in memory. This is particularly handy when your keys are protected by a passphrase: you can unlock and add your keys to the agent once and, from then on, any SSH client such as &lt;code>ssh(1)&lt;/code> can interact with the keys without asking you for the passphrase again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The SSH agent becomes even handier when you primarily work on a remote workstation over SSH. Under these circumstances, you will often need the remote workstation to establish SSH connections to &lt;em>other&lt;/em> remote machines (e.g. to contact GitHub). In those situations, you can: copy your private keys to the remote workstation; generate different private keys on the remote workstation; or forward your SSH agent so that the remote workstation can leverage the keys from your client machine without them ever traveling over the network.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
