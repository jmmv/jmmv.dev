What that means is, basically, to construct a single array that contains the concatenation of all the arrays inside the AoA.
My first answer was: "foldr", but I knew beforehand that he wouldn't like it because... this is Haskell. After some time we got to the conclusion that there is no trivial way to flatten an AoA in Perl 5, even though Perl 6 includes a built-in function to do so.</description></item></channel></rss>
