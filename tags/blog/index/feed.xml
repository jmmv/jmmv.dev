      <title>What makes an article succeed (or not)?</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/successful-articles.html</link>

      <description>This is what landing on the Hacker News front page does to your usually-dormant site:
 Number of total daily visitors of this site over the last few days.  In other words, this is what the Windows Subsystem for Linux: The lost potential post caused:
 a ridiculous jump from the usual ~80 visits per day to 6,000 on day one, 9,000 on day two, and 1,000 on day three; 200 comments on Hacker News in less than 24 hours and a ripple of discussions in Reddit and OSnews; a very insightful chat with a long-term NTFS engineer on general system performance; and an incredibly poor conversion rate with only 5 new Twitter followers and 3 new email subscribers.</description>

      <title>From Jekyll to Hugo</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/02/from-jekyll-to-hugo.html</link>

      <description>It is done. This site is now powered by Hugo instead of Jekyll. It took me a full week&amp;rsquo;s worth of early mornings to achieve, but the results are great&amp;hellip; internally, that is, because as a reader you should notice no changes other than minor style tweaks.
Performance differences As of today, this site hosts 711 posts totaling 3.4MB of text. The style sheet is based on Bootstrap and is built from scratch using SASS.</description>

      <title>Looking to replace Jekyll</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/02/looking-to-replace-jekyll.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmmv.dev/2015/05/hello-medium.html&#34;&gt;May 2015&lt;/a&gt;, I was lured to Medium by its simplicity and growing community, which resulted in me posting a bunch of articles there and enjoying every moment of it. But, eventually, I noticed that &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmmv.dev/2016/01/medium-experiment-wrapup.html&#34;&gt;I was losing control of my content&lt;/a&gt;. So &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmmv.dev/2016/05/homepage-v3.html&#34;&gt;a year later&lt;/a&gt;, my experiments to create static homepage resulted in me moving from Blogger and Medium to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;-managed site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost two years have passed since that migration and I can only count 7 miserable new posts. This ridiculously-low number, unfortunately, doesn&amp;rsquo;t track my willingness to writeâ€”but &lt;strong&gt;the friction to posting has become so high&lt;/strong&gt; that I fear composing new essays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Medium experiment wrap-up</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2016/01/medium-experiment-wrapup.html</link>

      <description>Eight months ago, I decided to try Medium as the platform on which to post my essays. Over this time I have published a handful of posts in there&amp;mdash;8, to be precise, which is&amp;hellip; a very shy number&amp;mdash;but the results have been quite satisfactory: the WYSIWYG composer is excellent, the analytics tools are simple but to the point, the looks are great, and the community is nice (though I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to tap into it just yet).</description>

      <description>For the last couple of weeks, I have been pondering the creation of a Kyua-specific blog. And, after a lot of consideration, I have finally taken the plunge. Say hello to Engineering Kyua!
From now on, all Kyua-related posts (as well as ATF posts) will go to the new blog.&amp;nbsp;I recommend you to subscribe to&amp;nbsp;Engineering Kyua&#39;s Atom feed&amp;nbsp;right now to not miss a beat! &amp;nbsp;If you care enough about Kyua, that is.</description>

      <title>Blog migrated to new Blogger beta</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2006/08/blog-migrated-to-new-blogger-beta.html</link>

      <description>Blogger announced yesterday multiple improvements to their service. These are still in beta &amp;mdash; as almost all other Google stuff, you know ;-) &amp;mdash; and are being offered to existing users progressively. To my surprise, the option to migrate was available on my dashboard today so I applied for it; I was very interested in the post labelling feature.
The migration process has been flawless and trivial. After the change nothing seemed to have changed except for some minor nits in the UI.</description>
