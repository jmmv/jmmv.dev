In fact, today marks the 20th anniversary of this publication in its various incarnations so it&rsquo;s time for a bit of reflection.</p><p>Just to set context for when 20 years ago was: Windows XP was almost 3 years old, Ubuntu had just debuted, Apple computers were still PowerPC-based, Half Life 2 was about to launch, and Slashdot was the place to be instead of the yet-to-be-created Hacker News. As for myself, I was still in college, had copious amounts of free time, and was a really active contributor to NetBSD.</p></p><p class=text-muted>June 22, 2024

The radio silence for the last two months has an explanation. I&rsquo;ve been busy creating a custom email subscription service for this blog, all so that you can be notified about new posts without the noise added by intermediaries. This feature is built into a little Rust web service that already offered analytics, page comments and more, and that can be potentially integrated into arbitrary static websites. Read on for what was involved, stay tuned for a deep dive on the internals, and&mldr; upfront apologies if this first email does the wrong thing!</p><p class=text-muted>June 16, 2023

And, after a lot of consideration, I have finally taken the plunge. <b>Say hello to <a href=http://engineering-kyua.blogspot.com/>Engineering Kyua</a>!</b><div><br></div><div>From now on, all Kyua-related posts (as well as ATF posts) will go to the new blog.&nbsp;I recommend you to <b>subscribe to&nbsp;<a href=http://engineering-kyua.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default>Engineering Kyua's Atom feed</a>&nbsp;right now</b> to not miss a beat! &nbsp;If you care enough about Kyua, that is...</div><div><br></div><div>I may still post Kyua-related stuff in here once in a while, but you should assume that all news and, in particular, weekly status reports will be sent to the new blog.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>"Why?" Well, The Julipedia is supposed to be (and always has) my personal blog. Looking back at all the recent posts, they almost univocally are about Kyua and there is no personal content in them. In respect for the readers of this blog (who may not care about Kyua at all) and in order to attempt to give Kyua a more definite identity, it makes sense to move the posts to their own blog.</div><div><br></div><div>Also, by having a blog dedicated to Kyua, I will not feel uncomfortable about publishing weekly status reports again. I previously felt that they were adding too much noise to this blog, and is the main reason behind why I stopped posting them at some point. Weekly reports have their value, mostly to keep myself focused and to allow outsiders to know what the project is up to (particularly in a world of DVCSs, where code changes may be kept private for weeks at a time).</div><div><br></div><div>And you may wonder: "will you continue to post content here?" Sure I will, but I need ideas (suggestions welcome)! Today's social ecosystem makes it difficult for me to decide whether a post belongs in a blog, in Google+, in Twitter... and updating them all at once to provide the same content is pointless.</div><div><br></div><div>Here is my take: for most of the irrelevant stuff that one may want to share at a personal level (photos, videos, arbitrary thoughts), social networks seem to provide a better platform. The blog seems a place more suited for short essays that should be indexable and be accessible by users across the web; for example, these include how-tos, technical explanations for a particular concept, or opinion articles. And, finally, Twitter seems like the place to throw pointers to longer articles elsewhere and very short opinion comments. I think this summarizes pretty well what my current "practices" around these systems follow. And, as you can deduce, this also explains (as you have experienced) why the blog gets fewer content than ever because most things are better suited for a social network.</div></p><p class=text-muted>June 4, 2012

These are still in beta &mdash; as almost all other <a href=http://www.google.com/>Google</a> stuff, you know ;-) &mdash; and are being offered to existing users progressively. To my surprise, the option to migrate was available on my dashboard today so I applied for it; I was very interested in the post labelling feature.<br><br>The migration process has been flawless and trivial. After the change nothing seemed to have changed except for some minor nits in the UI. I looked around for the labels feature but discovered that it is only available once you migrate to the new "layouts system", an easier way to desing your blog's look.<br><br>The switch to layouts scared me a bit because I was afraid of not being able to integrate the <a href=http://www.statcounter.com/>Statcounter</a> code back again. But after verifying that the change was reversible, I tried it. I can confirm that the new customization page is much, much easier to use than before, although still too limited (direct HTML editing is not available yet). Oh, and I seized the oportunity to switch to a slightly different theme (yes, it was available before).<br><br>Aside from that there are some new nice features such as RSS feeds (weren't they there before?), a better archive navigation (see the right bar), integration with Google accounts and many other things I'm surely missing.<br><br>Summarizing: It has taken a long while for the Google people to upgrade Blogger's service, but the wait has been worth it. Now more than ever, I don't regret <a href=http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2005/10/blog-migrated-to-blogger-welcome.html>migrating from Livejournal</a> to this site almost a year ago.</p><p class=text-muted>August 16, 2006
