      <description>Past weekend, for some strange reason, I decided to dump all the MBP&#39;s hard disk contents and start again from scratch. But this time I decided to split the disk into multiple partitions for Mac OS X, to avoid external fragmentation slowdowns as much as possible.
I already did such a thing back when the MBP was new. At that time, I created a partition for the system files and another for the user data.</description>

      <title>How to disable journaling on a HFS&#43; volume</title>

      <description>Mac OS X&amp;rsquo;s native file system (HFS+) supports journaling, a feature that is enabled by default on all new volumes. Journaling is a very nice feature as it allows a quick recovery of the file system&amp;rsquo;s status should anything bad happen to the machine â€” e.g. a power failure or a crash. With a journaled file system, the operating system can easily undo or redo the last operations executed on the disk without losing meta-data, effectively avoiding a full file system check.</description>

      <title>CVS and fragmentation</title>

      <description>First of all, happy new year to everybody!
I&#39;ve recently got a MacBook Pro and, while this little machine is great overall, the 5400 RPM hard disk is a noticeable performance bottleneck. Many people I&#39;ve talked to say that the difference from 5400 to 7200 RPM should not be noticeable because:These 2.5-inch drives use perpendicular recording, hence storing data with a higher bit density. This means that, theorically, they can read/write data more quickly achieving speeds similar to 7200 RPM drives.</description>
