      <description>This being Thanksgiving week in the U.S. and Google giving us Thursday and Friday off, I decided to take Monday to Wednesday off as well to spend some time hacking on Kyua &amp;mdash; yes, finally, after months of being inactive. And what a three productive days!
Here comes a little briefing on the three fronts in which I made progress. (This puts on hold the header files series until next Monday.</description>

      <title>A brief look into Fedora&#39;s packaging infrastructure</title>

      <description>As you probably know, I have been a long-time &#34;evangelist&#34; of pkgsrc. I started contributing to this packaging system when I first tried NetBSD in 2001 by sending new packages for small tools, and I later became a very active contributor while maintaining the GNOME packages. My active involvement came to an end a few years ago when I switched to OS X, but I still maintain a few packages and use pkgsrc in my multiple machines: a couple of NetBSD systems and 3 OS X machines.</description>

      <title>Blacklisting a device in HAL</title>

      <description>I have an old Aiptek mini PenCam 1.3 MPixels, identified by USB vendor 1276 and product 20554. I want to use this webcam for videoconferencing in the machine I am setting up for this purpose. This machine carries a Fedora 9 x86_64 installation, as already mentioned in the previous post.
Whenever I connect the camera to the machine, HAL detects the new device and then GNOME attempts to &#34;mount&#34; it using gphoto2.</description>

      <title>Desktop effects with an nVidia card and Fedora 9</title>

      <description>I&#39;m setting up a machine at home to act as a videoconferencing station so that my family can easily talk to me during the summer, while I&#39;m in NYC. This machine is equipped with an Athlon 64-bit processor and a nVidia GeForce 6200 PCI-Express video card. I decided to install Fedora 9 in this computer because this is the distribution I&#39;m currently using everywhere (well, everywhere except on the Mac ;-).</description>

      <title>lib64 problems</title>

      <description>Linux distributions for the x86_64 platform have different approaches when it comes to the installation of 32-bit and 64-bit libraries. In a 64-bit platform, 64-bit libraries are required to run all the standard applications but 32-bit libraries need to be available to provide compatibility with 32-bit binaries. In this post, I consider 64-bit applications to be the native ones and the 32-bit to be foreign.
The two major approaches I have seen are:</description>

      <title>Mad at the Cell SDK</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been installing the Cell SDK 3.0 on two Fedora 8 systems at home &amp;mdash; a PlayStation 3 and an old AMD box &amp;mdash; and I cannot understand how someone (IBM and BSC) can publish such an utterly broken piece of crap and be proud of it. Sorry, had to say it. (If you are one of those who wrote the installer, please excuse me, but that&#39;s what I really think.</description>
