Once Bazel has finished loading and analyzing the build graph, Bazel enters the execution phase. In this phase, the primary thing that Bazel does is walk the graph looking for actions to execute. Then, for each action, Bazel invokes its commands&amp;mdash;things like compiler and linker invocations&amp;mdash;as subprocesses.</description>
