It was picked up on January 30th, and it has been returned today just after 6 days (4 work days). Note that the technical service's office was located in Portugal, just at the opposite side of the peninsula.
And best of all, the monitor is fixed: firmware updated, so I can now disable the Overscan feature and get a perfect 1:1 pixel mapping on the HDMI input.</description></item><item><title>BenQ RMA adventures, part 1</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/01/benq-rma-adventures-part-1.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2008 17:34:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/01/benq-rma-adventures-part-1.html</guid><description>A couple of weeks ago, I called BenQ's RMA service to ask for a fix for my new FP241W Z. I have problems with the HDMI digital input: the monitor crops part of the image on each side and makes it slightly bigger to fill all the screen. It turns out that there is a firmware upgrade for this specific monitor that adds a configuration option to turn off overscan, which effectively should resolve this problem.</description></item></channel></rss>
