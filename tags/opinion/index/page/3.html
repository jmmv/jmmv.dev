I really, really do, and I agree with the premise that memory-unsafe languages like C++ should not be used anymore. But claiming that Rust would have <em>prevented</em> the massive outage that the world went through last Friday is misleading and actively harmful to Rust&rsquo;s evangelism.</p><p>Having CrowdStrike written in Rust would have <em>minimized</em> the chances of the outage happening, but not resolved the root cause that allowed the outage to happen in the first place. Thus, it irks me to see various folks blanket-claiming that Rust is the answer. It&rsquo;s not, and pushing this agenda hurts Rust&rsquo;s adoption more than it helps: C++ experts can understand the root cause and see that this claim is misleading, causing further divide in the systems programming world.</p><p>So, why won&rsquo;t Rust help? Let me try to answer that question, but while we are at it, let&rsquo;s also delve deeper into the causes of the outage. In a way, let me put my SRE hat on and write my own version of the postmortem.</p></p><p class=text-muted>July 23, 2024

As I frantically typed that article while replying to angry tweets, the thought came to mind: software engineering as a whole is hyper-focused on lowering the costs to write new code, yet there is a disregard for the costs that these improvements bring to other disciplines in a company on even to end users.</p><p>So, in this series finale, I want to compare how some choices that apparently lower development costs actually increase costs elsewhere. I also want to highlight how, if we made different decisions during development, we could possibly expose those extra costs early on. This is beneficial because exposing costs upfront allows us to make tough choices when there is still a chance of changing course.</p><p>To make things specific, I will look at how the use of modern frameworks that facilitate development can end up hurting performance, reliability, and usability. So let&rsquo;s start with a three-part rant first (sorry) and then let&rsquo;s look at what we might do.</p></p><p class=text-muted>August 31, 2023

Today, I&rsquo;ll expore a different scenario to support the same idea.

The <em>only</em> thing I want to compare is whether one approach centralizes toil and allows management to quantify its cost vs. how another approach hides toil by smearing it over the whole team in hard-to-quantify ways. Whether management <em>actually does something</em> to correct the situation once the costs are exposed is a different story.</p></p><p class=text-muted>August 26, 2023

Unfortunately, because such practices <em>feel</em> more expensive, teams choose to keep their status quo even when they know it is suboptimal. This choice ends up hurting productivity and morale because planned work is continuously interrupted, which in turn drags project completion.</p><p>The reason I say <em>seem</em> and not <em>are</em> is because the alternatives to these cost-exposing practices also suffer from costs. The difference is that, while the former surface costs, leading to the need to allocate time and people to infrastructure work, the latter keeps the costs smeared over teams and individuals in ways that are difficult to account and plan for.</p><p>To illustrate what I&rsquo;m trying to say, I&rsquo;ll present three different scenarios in which this opinion applies. All of these case studies come from past personal experiences while working in different teams and projects. The first one covered in this post is about the adoption of a monorepo vs. the use of multiple different repositories. The other two will come in follow-up articles.</p></p><p class=text-muted>August 23, 2023

I recorded a couple of crappy videos in 5 minutes, <a href=https://twitter.com/jmmv/status/1671670996921896960>posted them on a Twitter thread</a>, and went viral with 8.8K likes at this point. I really could not have predicted that, given that I&rsquo;ve been posting what-I-believe-is interesting content for years and&mldr; nothing, almost-zero interest. Now that things have cooled down, it&rsquo;s time to stir the pot and elaborate on those thoughts a bit more rationally.</p><p>To summarize, the Twitter thread shows two videos: one of an old computer running Windows NT 3.51 and one of a new computer running Windows 11. In each video, I opened and closed a command prompt, File Explorer, Notepad, and Paint. You can clearly see how apps on the old computer open up instantly whereas apps on the new computer show significant lag as they load. I questioned how computers are actually getting better when trivial things like this have regressed. And boom, the likes and reshares started coming in. Obviously some people had issues with my claims, but there seems to be an overwhelming majority of people that agree we have a problem.</p><p>To open up, I&rsquo;ll stand my ground: latency in modern computer interfaces, with modern OSes and modern applications, is terrible and getting worse. This applies to smartphones as well. At the same time, while UIs were much more responsible on computers of the past, those computers were also awful in many ways: new systems have changed our lives substantially. So, what gives?</p></p><p class=text-muted>June 27, 2023

The borrow checker is the first boss you must defeat, but with a good mental model of how memory works, how objects move, and the rules that the borrow checker enforces, it becomes second nature rather quickly. These rules may sound complicated, but really, they are about understanding the fundamentals of how a computer works.</p><p>That said&mldr; the difficulties don&rsquo;t stop there. Oh no. As you continue to learn about the language and start dealing with things like concurrency&mdash;or, God forbid, Unix signals&mdash;things can get tricky very quickly. To make matters worse, mastering <a href=https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/intro.html>idiomatic Rust</a> and <a href=/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html>the purpose of core traits</a> takes a lot of time. I&rsquo;ve had to throw my arms up in frustration a few times so far and, while I&rsquo;ve emerged from those exercises as a better programmer, I have to concede that they were exhausting experiences.

If left unattended, however, they become unmanageable monsters of tangled dependencies, slow builds, and frustrating developer experiences. Whether you have a good or bad experience directly depends on the level of engineering support behind the monorepo. Simply put, monorepos require dedicated teams and tools to run nicely.

So&mldr; you can color me skeptical when someone says that incremental build problems are due to bugs in the build files and not due to a suboptimal build system.

Instead, it should be under /usr/pkg/libdata/pkgdb/. The same applies to FreeBSD&rsquo;s and OpenBSD&rsquo;s ports and also Debian&rsquo;s dpkg, but I&rsquo;ll focus on pkgsrc because it&rsquo;s the system I know best. Let&rsquo;s see why the current default is suboptimal and why libdata is a good alternative.</p><p class=text-muted>August 26, 2020

They all should live in /libexec/rc.d/ because they are code, not configuration. Let&rsquo;s look at the history of these systems to see how we got here, why this is problematic, and how things would look like in a better world.</p><p class=text-muted>August 24, 2020
