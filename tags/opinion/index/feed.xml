      <title>Windows Subsystem for Linux: The lost potential</title>

      <description>If you have followed Windows 10 at all during the last few years, you know that the Windows Subsystem for Linux, or WSL for short, is the hot topic among developers. You can finally run your Linux tooling on Windows as a first class citizen, which means you no longer have to learn PowerShell or, god forbid, suffer through the ancient CMD.EXE console.
Unfortunately, not everything is as rosy as it sounds.</description>

      <title>pkgdb belongs in libdata, not var</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/pkgdb-libdata-var.html</link>

      <description>The pkgsrc package database, which by default lives in /var/db/pkg/, should not be there. Instead, it should be under /usr/pkg/libdata/pkgdb/. The same applies to FreeBSD&amp;rsquo;s and OpenBSD&amp;rsquo;s ports and also Debian&amp;rsquo;s dpkg, but I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on pkgsrc because it&amp;rsquo;s the system I know best. Let&amp;rsquo;s see why the current default is suboptimal and why libdata is a good alternative.</description>

      <title>rc.d belongs in libexec, not etc</title>

      <description>The scripts that live under /etc/rc.d/ in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD are in the wrong place. They all should live in /libexec/rc.d/ because they are code, not configuration. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the history of these systems to see how we got here, why this is problematic, and how things would look like in a better world.</description>
