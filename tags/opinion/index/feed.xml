      <title>pkgdb belongs in libdata, not var</title>

      <description>Right after discussing where rc.d should live, it&amp;rsquo;s time to tackle a different but related pet peeve of mine: the location of the installed packages database. For this, I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on the system I know best, pkgsrc, which keeps its database under /var/db/pkg/ by default. I think this location is wrong and the database should move to /usr/pkg/libdata/pkgdb/.
From a cursory look, it seems that FreeBSD&amp;rsquo;s and OpenBSD&amp;rsquo;s ports databases, as well as dpkg&amp;rsquo;s and rpm&amp;rsquo;s, are also affected by this &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;but I do not know enough about their internals to say with certainty.</description>

      <title>rc.d belongs in libexec, not etc</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s open with the controversy: the scripts that live under /etc/rc.d/ in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD are in the wrong place. They all should live in /libexec/rc.d/ because they are code, not configuration.
This misplacement is something that has bugged me for ages but I never had the energy to open this can of worms back when I was very involved in NetBSD. I suspect it would have been a draining discussion and a very difficult thing to change.</description>
