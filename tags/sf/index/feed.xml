      <description>I couldn&#39;t keep up with my plans yesterday. I started by walking through the Golden Gate Bridge (both ways) and then, on my way back, I ended up visiting Japantown and the area around the City Hall. I mean, I didn&#39;t visit the Golden Gate Park itself... but not a big deal since it seems similar to Central Park according to the maps.
At night, I met just one NetBSD developer in the 21st Amendment bar.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was my 2nd day of vacations at San Francisco but ended up so tired that I couldn&#39;t sit down to write this post. What did I do? Basically, yesterday was a walking day. I got out of the hotel early in the morning (around 9am) and came back at 4pm, just to leave again at 5.30pm and return at 8.30pm. That&#39;s a lot of hours of wandering around!
Basically, my path started at the hotel and I headed to the North Beach neighborhood through Downtown.</description>

      <description>That&#39;s it! I&#39;m in SF after my first &#34;vacations&#34; day. The trip, door to door, has taken around 12 hours; I got up at 4.45am in NYC, took the flight at 8.30am in JFK, arrived to SFO at 12.00pm and got to the hotel at around 2.00pm (all of these local times in their respective places; three-hour difference between eastern and western coasts). No cabs, which is what enlarged the total time a noticeable amount.</description>
