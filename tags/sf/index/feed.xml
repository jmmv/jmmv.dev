I started by walking through the Golden Gate Bridge (both ways) and then, on my way back, I ended up visiting Japantown and the area around the City Hall. I mean, I didn't visit the Golden Gate Park itself... but not a big deal since it seems similar to Central Park according to the maps.&lt;br />&lt;br />At night, I met just one NetBSD developer in the 21st Amendment bar.&lt;br />&lt;br />244 more photos to process.&lt;br />&lt;br />Today, time to visit the Berkeley campus.</description></item><item><title>Vacations@SF: 2nd day</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/11/vacationssf-2nd-day.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2008 11:56:00 -0500</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/11/vacationssf-2nd-day.html</guid><description>Yesterday was my 2nd day of vacations at San Francisco but ended up so tired that I couldn't sit down to write this post. What did I do? Basically, yesterday was a walking day. I got out of the hotel early in the morning (around 9am) and came back at 4pm, just to leave again at 5.30pm and return at 8.30pm. That's a lot of hours of wandering around!&lt;br />&lt;br />Basically, my path started at the hotel and I headed to the North Beach neighborhood through Downtown. From there, I climbed up to the Coit Tower; these hills are painful! Then I took the Powell steps to get to the Piers and walked north-west around the coast to end in the Aquatic Park. After that, a walk to the hotel to rest a little bit. And afterwards, headed Downtown again to have dinner at a place called Bocadillos, hoping that I'd find something similar to the Spanish "bocadillos"; no luck though, but the food was OK. At last, while returning home, I took pictures of some cool buildings decorated for Christmas.&lt;br />&lt;br />As a result, 202 more photos to process... I'll eventually post some, I guess.&lt;br />&lt;br />And the plan for today is to cross the Golden Gate, visit the Golden Gate Park and, in the evening, meet some local NetBSDers. Will see how that goes.</description></item><item><title>Vacations@SF: 1st day</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/11/vacationssf-1st-day.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2008 00:05:00 -0500</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/11/vacationssf-1st-day.html</guid><description>That's it! I'm in SF after my first "vacations" day. The trip, door to door, has taken around 12 hours; I got up at 4.45am in NYC, took the flight at 8.30am in JFK, arrived to SFO at 12.00pm and got to the hotel at around 2.00pm (all of these local times in their respective places; three-hour difference between eastern and western coasts). No cabs, which is what enlarged the total time a noticeable amount.&lt;br />&lt;br />The city seems pretty nice so far. More laid back than Manhattan... but still overpriced. And I miss some things from NYC such as the 24/7 availability of virtually everything (note, it is Sunday today!). Even though, I have been only able to explore the surroundings of the hotel today &amp;mdash; that is, Union Square and a bit of SoMA &amp;mdash; so this opinion may change in the following days. Dunno what I'll do in these other days yet, though.&lt;br />&lt;br />I've taken lots of pictures (103) but most of them are worthless due to poor lighting :( Anyway, I guess I'll eventually share some of them.&lt;br />&lt;br />Now, almost time to go to sleep. Jet lag is kicking in. I don't want to think how bad this will be when I go back to Spain!</description></item></channel></rss>
