      <description>I have had a Netgear WNDR3700v2 router for a few years already and I bought this model specifically because I could flash it with the open-source DD-WRT firmware. The reasons remain the same as the ones I had in 2006&amp;mdash;the key ones being: the ability to run a Dnsmasq DNS/DHCP server for my local network; and the ability to update a single Dynamic DNS address so that I can access my home network when I&amp;rsquo;m on the go.</description>

      <description>Past Christmas I bought a Linksys WRT54GSv4 router to improve wireless access to my home network. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;d have bought an access point, but I also wanted to replace most of my home server/router functionality with this little device so that I could eventually remove the server box. Therefore it had to provide:
 NAT. Firewalling. Port redirection. A dynamic DHCP server. Ability to configure DHCP static entries (used for servers within the network).</description>
