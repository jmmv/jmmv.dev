I hadn't bought it yet because I first wanted to check that the whole process was easy. The thing is that, after a couple of problems, I could disassemble it. So I then ran to the local store to buy the new drive. But oh! They didn't have it.</description></item><item><title>Is assembly code faster than C?</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/06/is-assembly-code-faster-than-c.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2007 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/06/is-assembly-code-faster-than-c.html</guid><description>I was reading an article the other day and found an assertion that bugged me. It reads:
System 6.0.8 is not only a lot more compact since it has far fewer (mostly useless) features and therefore less code to process, but also because it was written in assembly code instead of the higher level language C. The lower the level of the code language, the less processing cycles are required to get something done.</description></item></channel></rss>
