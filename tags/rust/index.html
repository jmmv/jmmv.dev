It&rsquo;s better to say <em>file descriptors</em> provide access to almost every system that the kernel provides, but not that they can all be manipulated with the same quartet of system calls, nor that they all behave as byte streams.</p><p>Because you see: network connections are manipulated via file descriptors indeed, but you don&rsquo;t <code>open</code> them: you <code>bind</code>, <code>listen</code>/<code>accept</code> and/or <code>connect</code> to them. And then you don&rsquo;t <code>read</code> from and <code>write</code> to network connections: you somehow <code>send</code> to and <code>recv</code> from them. Device drivers are similar: yes, hardware devices are represented as &ldquo;virtual files&rdquo; in the <code>/dev</code> hierarchy and many support <code>read</code> and <code>write</code>&mldr; but these two system calls are not sufficient to access the breath of functionality that the hardware drivers provide. No, you need <code>ioctl</code>.</p><p><code>ioctl</code> is the poster child of the system call that breaks Unix&rsquo;s &ldquo;everything is a file&rdquo; paradigm. <code>ioctl</code> is the API that allows out-of-band communication with the kernel side of an open file descriptor. To see cool examples, <a href=/2025/01/netbsd-graphics-wo-x11.html>refer back to my previous article</a> where I demonstrated how to drive graphics from the console without X11: in that post, we had to <code>open</code> the console device, but then we had to use <code>ioctl</code> to obtain the properties of the framebuffer, and then we had to <code>mmap</code> the device&rsquo;s content for direct access: no <code>read</code>s nor <code>write</code>s involved.</p><p>All the code I showed you in that earlier post was written in C to keep the graphics article to-the-point, but the code I&rsquo;m really working on is part of EndBASIC, and thus it is all Rust. And the thing is, <code>ioctl</code>s are not easy to issue from Rust. In fact, after 7 years of Rust-ing, it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve had to reach for <code>unsafe</code> code blocks, and there was no good documentation on how to deal with <code>ioctl</code>. So this posts aims to fix that by presenting what ways there are to call <code>ioctl</code>s from Rust&mldr; and, of course, diving a bit deeper into what <code>ioctl</code>s actually <em>are</em>.</p></p><p class=text-muted>February 13, 2025

I really, really do, and I agree with the premise that memory-unsafe languages like C++ should not be used anymore. But claiming that Rust would have <em>prevented</em> the massive outage that the world went through last Friday is misleading and actively harmful to Rust&rsquo;s evangelism.</p><p>Having CrowdStrike written in Rust would have <em>minimized</em> the chances of the outage happening, but not resolved the root cause that allowed the outage to happen in the first place. Thus, it irks me to see various folks blanket-claiming that Rust is the answer. It&rsquo;s not, and pushing this agenda hurts Rust&rsquo;s adoption more than it helps: C++ experts can understand the root cause and see that this claim is misleading, causing further divide in the systems programming world.</p><p>So, why won&rsquo;t Rust help? Let me try to answer that question, but while we are at it, let&rsquo;s also delve deeper into the causes of the outage. In a way, let me put my SRE hat on and write my own version of the postmortem.</p></p><p class=text-muted>July 23, 2024

Rust is particularly well-suited at this task: its lack of implicit type conversions eliminates surprises, and its ownership semantics allow type transformations with zero cost.</p><p>Unfortunately, (ab)using narrow types in an app&rsquo;s domain is <em>really</em> annoying when writing tests. While non-test code rarely instantiates new objects&mdash;in the case of a REST service, this would only happen at the service&rsquo;s boundaries&mdash;tests instantiate objects infinitely more times than non-test code. Code patterns that may seem reasonable in non-test code can become unbearable in tests.</p><p>In this post, I want to look into the various ways in which you can instantiate strongly-typed objects. For each, I show examples and describe their pros and cons. And yes, as a matter of fact, I have tried them all before&mldr; and I can&rsquo;t yet make my mind as to which one is best.</p></p><p class=text-muted>October 6, 2023

This looked like a bunch of <tt>Arc<dyn foo></tt> objects passed around and was done to support extremely fast unit testing.</p><p>When I generalized the core logic of these services into the III-IV framework, I decided to experiment with a switch to static dispatch. The rationale was that using static dispatch better aligns with the design of well-regarded crates in the Rust ecosystem, and also because I wanted to avoid unnecessary runtime costs in the foundational pieces of my web services.</p><p>Let me tell you that this decision was a huge mistake and that the experiment has utterly failed. Using static dispatch has been a constant source of frustration due to the difficulty in passing types around and reasoning about trait bounds. The situation had gotten so bad that I dreaded adding new functionality to my services whenever a change to a statically-typed <tt>struct</tt> was needed, because that meant adding yet another type parameter and plumbing it through tens of source files.</p><p>In lieu of the difficulties, which eventually turned into blockers to implementing new features, I made the choice of going back to dynamic dispatch. The goal was to gain ergonomics at the expense of a supposedly-negligible runtime cost. Let me tell you about the problems I faced, the refactoring journey, and some measurements I gathered after the rewrite.</p></p><p class=text-muted>August 6, 2023

The borrow checker is the first boss you must defeat, but with a good mental model of how memory works, how objects move, and the rules that the borrow checker enforces, it becomes second nature rather quickly. These rules may sound complicated, but really, they are about understanding the fundamentals of how a computer works.</p><p>That said&mldr; the difficulties don&rsquo;t stop there. Oh no. As you continue to learn about the language and start dealing with things like concurrency&mdash;or, God forbid, Unix signals&mdash;things can get tricky very quickly. To make matters worse, mastering <a href=https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/intro.html>idiomatic Rust</a> and <a href=/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html>the purpose of core traits</a> takes a lot of time.

During this period, I&rsquo;ve written a non-trivial amount of Go code both inside and <a href=/2017/08/introducing-sandboxfs.html>outside Google</a>, but never found the chance to sit back and learn Rust.</p><p>This changed a month ago during my yearly family trip to Korea. This time around, I decided upfront that I would <em>not</em> work on any personal or work projects for the 2-week long vacation. Instead, I would focus all spare time in reading. And I would read <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/>&ldquo;The Rust Programming Language&rdquo;, second edition</a>. The plan worked: getting through the book took the two weeks and I barely wrote any code.</p></p><p class=text-muted>May 25, 2018
