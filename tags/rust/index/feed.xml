      <title>Unit-testing a console app (a text editor)</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/unit-testing-a-console-app.html</link>

      <description>The most notable feature in EndBASIC 0.3 is its new full-screen console-based text editor. In this post, I describe why it is important and useful to unit-test a console app like this, and I will dive into how to implement unit tests that catch regressions and inefficiencies. Code samples are in Rust, but the concepts presented here are applicable to any language with minimal data abstraction facilities.</description>

      <title>Using the builder pattern to define test scenarios</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the builder patter to express test scenarios in a succinct and declarative manner. I&amp;rsquo;ve liked the outcome and feel that this design can yield to pretty good test code, so I&amp;rsquo;ll dig through this idea here. Note that, while this post and the associated code talk about Rust, &lt;strong&gt;the ideas presented here apply to any language&lt;/strong&gt;. So don&amp;rsquo;t leave just because I said Rust!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>After a 6-month long hiatus caused by me hunting and changing jobs and cities, I am pleased to announce the release of EndBASIC 0.3! The Thanksgiving break has been as fruitful as I had hoped üòÅ
There are two major changes in this release.
  The first is the official debut of the web-based interface. I introduced this months ago and have had it running on a &amp;ldquo;push on green&amp;rdquo; model, which means that the web deployment of EndBASIC is always tracking Git HEAD.</description>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/bridging-the-web-gap-endbasic.html</guid>
      <description>After a ton of work, a lot of which was unexpected, I am ecstatic to announce that EndBASIC is now a reality on the web! The whole language interpreter can now run as a fully client-side web app on a computer, on a tablet&amp;hellip; and even on a phone. Yes: the whole thing, which is written in Rust (94%), works in a modern browser with just a tiny bit of JavaScript glue (1%).</description>

      <title>EndBASIC 0.2.0 is here</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/endbasic-0.2.0.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/endbasic-0.2.0.html</guid>
      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I announced EndBASIC: a simple BASIC language interpreter written in Rust with a goal to provide an environment for teaching my kids how to code. That first release provided what-I-think-is a robust interpreter, but that was about it: the language features were still minimal and the interactive features were non-existent.
Well, EndBASIC 0.2.0 is here and things are changing! It&amp;rsquo;s still far from the vision I want to reach, but it&amp;rsquo;s slowly moving towards that direction.</description>

      <title>What is Rust&#39;s Into&lt;T&gt; for?</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 18:50:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html</guid>
      <description>Rust provides a bunch of traits that you may use or implement in your code, but unless you have experienced them first-hand, it can be hard to imagine what their real utility is. For example, if you go read Into&amp;rsquo;s documentation, all you find is:
 Trait std::convert::Into
A value-to-value conversion that consumes the input value. The opposite of From. [&amp;hellip;]
 Yay, very useful. This text tells me what this trait does, which is fine for a reference manual, but not when I could find it useful.</description>

      <title>Hello, EndBASIC!</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/hello-endbasic.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/hello-endbasic.html</guid>
      <description>Introducing EndBASIC, a new interpreter for a BASIC-like language that is inspired by Amstrad&amp;rsquo;s Locomotive BASIC 1.1 and Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s QuickBASIC 4.5. Like the former, EndBASIC intends to provide an interactive environment that seamlessly merges coding with immediate visual feedback. Like the latter, EndBASIC offers higher-level programming constructs and strong typing. The main idea behind EndBASIC is to provide a playground for learning the foundations of programming in a simplified environment.</description>

      <title>Sample REST interface in Rust and Go</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2019/09/rest-api-rust-go.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2019/09/rest-api-rust-go.html</guid>
      <description>Over the summer, I prototyped a bunch of web apps whose ideas had been floating in my mind for a long time. I spent some time reading through REST API documentation pages and, as part of these exercises, implemented sample RESTful web services in both Go and Rust. (Just for context, the last time I wrote a web app was in high school&amp;hellip; and it involved PHP, MySQL, and I think IE6?</description>

      <title>Rust vs. Go</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/07/rust-vs-go.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/07/rust-vs-go.html</guid>
      <description>There is no good answer to this question: people tend to put Go and Rust in the same bucket because they were released at around the same time, because Rust&amp;rsquo;s release felt like a response to Go&amp;rsquo;s, and because they are marketed to similar audiences.  They are, however, vastly different.  So let&amp;rsquo;s give in and compare them anyway.</description>

      <title>Rust review: Closing thoughts</title>

      <description>Thought that the Rust review was over? Think again; I was just on vacation! I&amp;rsquo;m back now to conclude the series with a bunch of random thoughts and a surprise follow-up post.
 The series is coming to an end. It&amp;rsquo;s time to summarize everything we have discussed so far and to cover a few more items that didn&amp;rsquo;t really deserve full posts of their own. Most of these miscellaneous items were thoughts that I jotted down while reading TRPL book.</description>

      <title>Rust review: The ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-ecosystem.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-ecosystem.html</guid>
      <description>In this part of the review, I would like to focus on Rust&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem: in other words, how Rust plays with other parts of a functioning system and how Rust&amp;rsquo;s standard library vs. external libraries interact with each other. There are a lot of pieces to cover in these areas and they have left me with mixed feelings. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some.
The standard library The std library feels generally well-thought out and full of features.</description>

      <title>Rust review: The book</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-book.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-book.html</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;The Rust Programming Language&amp;rdquo; is one of the free books that the community has put together to teach the language. The book does a good job in general, but there are some things that could be better. Let&amp;rsquo;s cover these, but first, some background.
A couple of years ago, right after getting started with Rust, I tried to go through the book&amp;rsquo;s first few chapters. It all sounded cool&amp;hellip; but the first edition of the book moved at a glacially slow pace because it covered things in excruciating detail.</description>

      <title>Rust review: The match keyword</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-match-keyword.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Jun 2018 09:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-match-keyword.html</guid>
      <description>A commonly-acclaimed feature of Rust is its match keyword: a &amp;ldquo;conditional on steroids&amp;rdquo;. match lets you take the value of an expression and compare it against a bunch of values‚Äîor, more generally, patterns.
As you write and read Rust, you will notice that this keyword is used everywhere because it&amp;rsquo;s the way to access certain types, like Option values or error codes.
For example:
matchnode.get_parent(){// node is an Option&amp;lt;Something&amp;gt;. Some(parent)=&amp;gt;{// Do something with &amp;#34;parent&amp;#34;, which we know points to a node.</description>

      <title>Rust review: Expressions, expressions, expressions</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-expressions.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2018 09:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-expressions.html</guid>
      <description>Rust resembles a functional language in many ways although it does not claim to be one. In fact, I have been thinking of Rust as a &amp;ldquo;pragmatic Haskell&amp;rdquo; or as a &amp;ldquo;well-balanced mixture between C++ and Haskell&amp;quot;.
One of the ways the functional aspects show up is via expressions and how pretty much any construct in Rust can be treated as an expression. But before we begin, a little warning: the examples below are, by no means, idiomatic Rust‚ÄîI just hope they are simple enough to illustrate what I want to show.</description>

      <title>Rust review: Learning curve</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-learning-curve.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2018 09:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/06/rust-review-learning-curve.html</guid>
      <description>Writing Rust code is not restricted to programming gurus‚Äîbut there is no denying that the learning curve is steeper than that of other languages. Or is it? In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to convince you that the curve does feel steep, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t when taken into perspective.
Let&amp;rsquo;s first start by stating that learning a language is not the same as learning its syntax. Learning a language involves learning the syntax, of course, but it also involves familiarizing oneself with its common idioms and grabbing a good sense of what the standard libraries provide.</description>
