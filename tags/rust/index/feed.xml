The latter was a fork of the former and thus the foundations were the same, but as I iterated on the latter more recently, I got to refine my approach to writing a REST API in Rust.
During this refactoring process, there was a small piece of the system that routinely got in the way for various reasons.</description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.6 release announcement</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/02/endbasic-0.6.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/02/endbasic-0.6.html</guid><description>After a very active month of development since the 0.5 announcement, it is time to welcome EndBASIC 0.6!
This new 0.6 release is super-exciting for three reasons:
preliminary GPIO support in the standard library specifically tailored to the Raspberry Pi; multidimensional array support in the language; and availability of binary releases for the most common platforms. You can dive right in by:

This makes it hard to embed those interpreters into other programs because it&amp;rsquo;s not obvious how to limit their side-effects and because the interpreter dependency can be heavy. In this post, we will see how EndBASIC&amp;rsquo;s design tries hard to keep the core as small as possible, and we will see some examples on how to use EndBASIC from Rust and vice versa.</description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.5 release announcement</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/endbasic-0.5.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2021 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/endbasic-0.5.html</guid><description>A month has passed since the 0.4.0 announcement so it is about time to say hello to yet another EndBASIC release because 0.5.0 is here! So, what&amp;rsquo;s new? Not much&amp;hellip; unless you look under the covers, in which case a &lt;em>ton&lt;/em> has changed. About 30% of the codebase has been affected in one way or another to improve general quality, so read on to see how.</description></item><item><title>Enforcing code health via GitHub Actions</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/github-actions-code-health.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2021 09:50:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/github-actions-code-health.html</guid><description>It is no secret that, in software development, the edit+build+test cycle must be as short as possible. The delay between saving a file and seeing the results has to be minimal and in the order of a few seconds, or else developers lose focus and productivity suffers.
It&amp;rsquo;s equally important to ensure that the code is held to certain quality standards. Compiler warnings, for example, are part of any compilation and catch a set of common problems.</description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.4 release announcement</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/endbasic-0.4.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Dec 2020 19:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/endbasic-0.4.html</guid><description>About a month ago and after a long hiatus, I published EndBASIC 0.3 and the adrenaline rush that came with it got my wheels spinning again full-steam ahead. So here I am today, ready to announce the 0.4 release. But&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;what could have possibly changed in just a month of someone&amp;rsquo;s free time&amp;rdquo;, you wonder? Enough, actually!
EndBASIC 0.4 is the release that fulfills my original goal of being able to run a &amp;ldquo;guess the number&amp;rdquo; game.</description></item><item><title>Unit-testing a console app (a text editor)</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/unit-testing-a-console-app.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 10:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/unit-testing-a-console-app.html</guid><description>The most notable feature in EndBASIC 0.3 is its new full-screen console-based text editor. In this post, I describe why it is important and useful to unit-test a console app like this, and I will dive into how to implement unit tests that catch regressions and inefficiencies. Code samples are in Rust, but the concepts presented here are applicable to any language with minimal data abstraction facilities.</description></item><item><title>Using the builder pattern to define test scenarios</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2020 09:40:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the builder patter to express test scenarios in a succinct and declarative manner. I&amp;rsquo;ve liked the outcome and feel that this design can yield to pretty good test code, so I&amp;rsquo;ll dig through this idea here. Note that, while this post and the associated code talk about Rust, &lt;strong>the ideas presented here apply to any language&lt;/strong>.

The Thanksgiving break has been as fruitful as I had hoped üòÅ
There are two major changes in this release.
The first is the official debut of the web-based interface. I introduced this months ago and have had it running on a &amp;ldquo;push on green&amp;rdquo; model, which means that the web deployment of EndBASIC is always tracking Git HEAD.</description></item><item><title>Bridging the web gap in EndBASIC</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/bridging-the-web-gap-endbasic.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2020 08:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/bridging-the-web-gap-endbasic.html</guid><description>After a ton of work, a lot of which was unexpected, I am ecstatic to announce that EndBASIC is now a reality on the web! The whole language interpreter can now run as a fully client-side web app on a computer, on a tablet&amp;hellip; and even on a phone. Yes: the whole thing, which is written in Rust (94%), works in a modern browser with just a tiny bit of JavaScript glue (1%).</description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.2.0 is here</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/endbasic-0.2.0.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 06:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/endbasic-0.2.0.html</guid><description>A couple of weeks ago, I announced EndBASIC: a simple BASIC language interpreter written in Rust with a goal to provide an environment for teaching my kids how to code. That first release provided what-I-think-is a robust interpreter, but that was about it: the language features were still minimal and the interactive features were non-existent.
Well, EndBASIC 0.2.0 is here and things are changing! It&amp;rsquo;s still far from the vision I want to reach, but it&amp;rsquo;s slowly moving towards that direction.</description></item><item><title>What is Rust's Into&lt;T> for?</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 18:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html</guid><description>Rust provides a bunch of traits that you may use or implement in your code, but unless you have experienced them first-hand, it can be hard to imagine what their real utility is. For example, if you go read Into&amp;rsquo;s documentation, all you find is:
Trait std::convert::Into
A value-to-value conversion that consumes the input value. The opposite of From. [&amp;hellip;]
Yay, very useful. This text tells me what this trait does, which is fine for a reference manual, but not when I could find it useful.</description></item><item><title>Hello, EndBASIC!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/hello-endbasic.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 09:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/hello-endbasic.html</guid><description>Introducing EndBASIC, a new interpreter for a BASIC-like language that is inspired by Amstrad&amp;rsquo;s Locomotive BASIC 1.1 and Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s QuickBASIC 4.5. Like the former, EndBASIC intends to provide an interactive environment that seamlessly merges coding with immediate visual feedback. Like the latter, EndBASIC offers higher-level programming constructs and strong typing. The main idea behind EndBASIC is to provide a playground for learning the foundations of programming in a simplified environment.</description></item><item><title>Sample REST interface in Rust and Go</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2019/09/rest-api-rust-go.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2019 06:45:40 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2019/09/rest-api-rust-go.html</guid><description>Over the summer, I prototyped a bunch of web apps whose ideas had been floating in my mind for a long time. I spent some time reading through REST API documentation pages and, as part of these exercises, implemented sample RESTful web services in both Go and Rust. (Just for context, the last time I wrote a web app was in high school&amp;hellip; and it involved PHP, MySQL, and I think IE6?</description></item><item><title>Rust vs. Go</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/07/rust-vs-go.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2018 10:45:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/07/rust-vs-go.html</guid><description>There is no good answer to this question: people tend to put Go and Rust in the same bucket because they were released at around the same time, because Rust&amp;rsquo;s release felt like a response to Go&amp;rsquo;s, and because they are marketed to similar audiences. They are, however, vastly different. So let&amp;rsquo;s give in and compare them anyway.</description></item></channel></rss>
