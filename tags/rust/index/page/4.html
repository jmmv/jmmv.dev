I really, really do, and I agree with the premise that memory-unsafe languages like C++ should not be used anymore. But claiming that Rust would have prevented the massive outage that the world went through last Friday is misleading and actively harmful to Rust&rsquo;s evangelism.
Having CrowdStrike written in Rust would have minimized the chances of the outage happening, but not resolved the root cause that allowed the outage to happen in the first place. Thus, it irks me to see various folks blanket-claiming that Rust is the answer. It&rsquo;s not, and pushing this agenda hurts Rust&rsquo;s adoption more than it helps: C++ experts can understand the root cause and see that this claim is misleading, causing further divide in the systems programming world.
So, why won&rsquo;t Rust help? Let me try to answer that question, but while we are at it, let&rsquo;s also delve deeper into the causes of the outage. In a way, let me put my SRE hat on and write my own version of the postmortem.</p><p class=text-muted>July 23, 2024

Rust is particularly well-suited at this task: its lack of implicit type conversions eliminates surprises, and its ownership semantics allow type transformations with zero cost.
Unfortunately, (ab)using narrow types in an app&rsquo;s domain is really annoying when writing tests. While non-test code rarely instantiates new objects&mdash;in the case of a REST service, this would only happen at the service&rsquo;s boundaries&mdash;tests instantiate objects infinitely more times than non-test code. Code patterns that may seem reasonable in non-test code can become unbearable in tests.
In this post, I want to look into the various ways in which you can instantiate strongly-typed objects. For each, I show examples and describe their pros and cons. And yes, as a matter of fact, I have tried them all before&mldr; and I can&rsquo;t yet make my mind as to which one is best.</p><p class=text-muted>October 6, 2023

This looked like a bunch of Arc objects passed around and was done to support extremely fast unit testing.
When I generalized the core logic of these services into the III-IV framework, I decided to experiment with a switch to static dispatch. The rationale was that using static dispatch better aligns with the design of well-regarded crates in the Rust ecosystem, and also because I wanted to avoid unnecessary runtime costs in the foundational pieces of my web services.
Let me tell you that this decision was a huge mistake and that the experiment has utterly failed. Using static dispatch has been a constant source of frustration due to the difficulty in passing types around and reasoning about trait bounds. The situation had gotten so bad that I dreaded adding new functionality to my services whenever a change to a statically-typed struct was needed, because that meant adding yet another type parameter and plumbing it through tens of source files.
In lieu of the difficulties, which eventually turned into blockers to implementing new features, I made the choice of going back to dynamic dispatch. The goal was to gain ergonomics at the expense of a supposedly-negligible runtime cost. Let me tell you about the problems I faced, the refactoring journey, and some measurements I gathered after the rewrite.</p><p class=text-muted>August 6, 2023

To make things specific, I'll be describing the testing infrastructure of EndTRACKER, the EndBASIC Service, and the sample key/value store app of III-IV.

The borrow checker is the first boss you must defeat, but with a good mental model of how memory works, how objects move, and the rules that the borrow checker enforces, it becomes second nature rather quickly. These rules may sound complicated, but really, they are about understanding the fundamentals of how a computer works.
That said&mldr; the difficulties don&rsquo;t stop there. Oh no. As you continue to learn about the language and start dealing with things like concurrency&mdash;or, God forbid, Unix signals&mdash;things can get tricky very quickly. To make matters worse, mastering idiomatic Rust and the purpose of core traits takes a lot of time. I&rsquo;ve had to throw my arms up in frustration a few times so far and, while I&rsquo;ve emerged from those exercises as a better programmer, I have to concede that they were exhausting experiences. And I am certainly not an expert yet.
So, yes, there is no denying in saying that Rust is harder than other languages. But&mldr; does it matter in practical terms?
Betteridge&rsquo;s law of headlines says that we should conclude the post right here with a &ldquo;no&rdquo;&mdash;and I think that&rsquo;s the right answer. But let&rsquo;s see why.</p><p class=text-muted>May 6, 2022

I wish I could answer this question with a &ldquo;no, there isn&rsquo;t&rdquo;, but that would be a lie: in any large community, there will certainly be hateful people/opinions. If you have encountered such flamebait, I&rsquo;m sorry, and I&rsquo;m not here to defend it.

The whole language interpreter can now run as a fully client-side web app on a computer, on a tablet&mldr; and even on a phone. Yes: the whole thing, which is written in Rust (94%), works in a modern browser with just a tiny bit of JavaScript glue (1%).</p><p class=text-muted>May 30, 2020

That first release provided what-I-think-is a robust interpreter, but that was about it: the language features were still minimal and the interactive features were non-existent.
Well, EndBASIC 0.2.0 is here and things are changing! It&rsquo;s still far from the vision I want to reach, but it&rsquo;s slowly moving towards that direction.</p><p class=text-muted>May 7, 2020

Trait std::convert::Into
A value-to-value conversion that consumes the input value. The opposite of From. [&mldr;]

The book does a good job in general, but there are some things that could be better. Let&rsquo;s cover these, but first, some background.
A couple of years ago, right after getting started with Rust, I tried to go through the book&rsquo;s first few chapters. It all sounded cool&mldr; but the first edition of the book moved at a glacially slow pace because it covered things in excruciating detail.</p><p class=text-muted>June 19, 2018

As you write and read Rust, you will notice that this keyword is used everywhere because it&rsquo;s the way to access certain types, like Option values or error codes.
For example:
match node.get_parent() { // node is an Option&lt;Something>.</p><p class=text-muted>June 15, 2018

In fact, I have been thinking of Rust as a &ldquo;pragmatic Haskell&rdquo; or as a &ldquo;well-balanced mixture between C++ and Haskell&rdquo;.
One of the ways the functional aspects show up is via expressions and how pretty much any construct in Rust can be treated as an expression. But before we begin, a little warning: the examples below are, by no means, idiomatic Rust—I just hope they are simple enough to illustrate what I want to show.</p><p class=text-muted>June 12, 2018

Or is it? In this post, I&rsquo;ll try to convince you that the curve does feel steep, but it isn&rsquo;t when taken into perspective.
Let&rsquo;s first start by stating that learning a language is not the same as learning its syntax. Learning a language involves learning the syntax, of course, but it also involves familiarizing oneself with its common idioms and grabbing a good sense of what the standard libraries provide.</p><p class=text-muted>June 8, 2018

I had always thought of mutexes as something that is easy to get wrong and was convinced that the use of a RAII pattern to prevent lock leaks never happen (like with Abseil&rsquo;s MutexLock) was the panacea. (I&rsquo;m a fan of RAII in C++ by the way, in case you haven&rsquo;t noticed.)</p><p class=text-muted>June 5, 2018

To understand why this is important, let&rsquo;s cover some context first. One of my pet peeves when reviewing C++ code is to ask authors to sprinkle the const qualifier everywhere: if something ain&rsquo;t mutated, say so explicitly. This includes marking local variables, function arguments, function return values, class attributes, etc.</p><p class=text-muted>May 29, 2018
