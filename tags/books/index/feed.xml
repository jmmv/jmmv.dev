      <description>After about two months, I finally finished reading Twitterville by Shel Israel (@shelisrael). One of my followers (@drio) asked for a review of the book, so here is my attempt to do so.
But first, a quick summary: Twitterville is a book that focuses on the dynamics of Twitter. It starts by explaining how Twitter works, but that is only a tiny introductory part of the book. The majority of the contents explain how people and business interact with each other by means of Twitter, and it does so by providing lots of real-life stories.</description>

      <description>I just finished reading the third book in a row from Joel Spolsky, titled Joel on Software. Before this one, I read More Joel on Software and The Best Software Writing 1, all in a bit over a month. Note: I hadn&#39;t read any book cover-to-cover for a loooong while. Very interesting and entertaining books; highly recommended.
Oh, and his writing style is really enjoyable. We, crappy blog writers, can learn a lot from him!</description>

      <title>Book: Producing Open Source Software</title>

      <description>This year, Google sent all the Summer of Code students the Producing Open Source Software: How to run a successful free software project book by Karl Fogel (ISBN 0-596-00759-0) as a welcome present.
I&#39;ve just finished reading it and I can say that it was a very nice read. The book is very easy to follow and is very complete: it covers areas such as the project&#39;s start-up, how to set things up for promoting it, how to behave in mailing lists, how to prepare releases, how to deal with volunteers or with paid developers, etc.</description>
