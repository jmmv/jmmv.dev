If so, you have come to the right place!
As you may already know, the Google Summer of Code 2014 program is on and FreeBSD has been accepted as a mentoring organization. As it so happens, I have a project idea that may sound interesting to you.
During the last few months, we have been hard at work adding a standardized test suite to the FreeBSD upstream source tree as described in the TestSuite project page.</description></item><item><title>NetBSD in Google Summer of Code 2010</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2010/03/netbsd-in-google-summer-of-code-2010.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2010 04:36:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2010/03/netbsd-in-google-summer-of-code-2010.html</guid><description>For the 6th year in a row, NetBSD is a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code 2010!
If you are a bright student willing to develop full-time for an open source project during this coming summer, consider applying with us! You will have a chance to work with very smart people and, most likely, in the area that you are most passionate about. NetBSD, being an operating system project, has offers for project ideas at all levels: from the kernel to the packaging system, passing by drivers, networking tools, user-space utilities, the system installer, automation tools and more!</description></item><item><title>NetBSD-SoC needs your application!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2009/04/netbsd-soc-needs-your-application.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2009 05:46:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2009/04/netbsd-soc-needs-your-application.html</guid><description>The Google Summer of Code 2009 application deadline for students is tomorrow and NetBSD has got very few applications so far. If you have the interest in working on a cool operating system project, where almost any project idea can fit, take the time to read our proposals and apply! New, original ideas not listed there will also be considered.
It'd be a pity if the number of assigned slots to NetBSD was small due to the low number of applications!</description></item><item><title>ATF 0.6 released</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2009/01/atf-06-released.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2009 15:01:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2009/01/atf-06-released.html</guid><description>I am very happy to announce the availability of the 0.6 release of ATF. I have to apologize for this taking so long because the code has been mostly-ready for a while. However, doing the actual release procedure is painful. Testing the code in many different configurations to make sure it works, preparing the release files, uploading them, announcing the new release on multiple sites... not something I like doing often.</description></item><item><title>SoC 2008 Mentor Summit</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/10/soc-2008-mentor-summit.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2008 23:16:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/10/soc-2008-mentor-summit.html</guid><description>The Google SoC 2008 Mentor Summit is now officially over. The summit has taken place during the whole weekend and has been pretty intensive. The organization of the whole event has been excellent thanks to the hard work of Leslie Hawthorn among others; sorry, can't remember your names... I'm very bad at this.
We have had multiple sessions, ranging from technical ones such as distributed version control systems to more political ones such as how to deal with assholes in open source projects.</description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: ... or not; now in MTV!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/10/livenyc-or-not-now-in-mtv.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2008 19:08:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/10/livenyc-or-not-now-in-mtv.html</guid><description>I've landed this morning in San Francisco at 9.00am (which means I left NYC at 6.00am!) and went straight down to the Google Headquarters in Mountain View. No sleep at all except for a little bit of pseudo-sleep in the plane. The Google campus is really nice. It puts the NYC offices in an inferior level than I thought :P But the only problem is that the area surrounding the campus is basically empty.</description></item><item><title>Google Summer of Code 2008 and NetBSD</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/03/google-summer-of-code-2008-and-netbsd.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2008 06:36:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/03/google-summer-of-code-2008-and-netbsd.html</guid><description>Google has launched the Summer of Code program once again this year, and NetBSD is a mentoring organization for the fourth time as announced in a netbsd-announce post. Unless things go very wrong in the following days, I will not take part this year as a student because I will be intering at Google SRE during the Summer!
However, I will try to become a mentor for the "Convert all remaining regression tests to ATF"</description></item><item><title>SoC: Second preview of NetBSD with ATF</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/08/soc-second-preview-of-netbsd-with-atf.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2007 15:49:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/08/soc-second-preview-of-netbsd-with-atf.html</guid><description>Reposting from the original ATF news entry:
I have just updated the first preview of NetBSD-current release builds with ATF merged in to match the ATF 0.1 release published today. As already stated in the old news item: These will ease testing to the casual user who is interested in this project because he will not need to mess with patches to the NetBSD source tree nor rebuild a full release, which is a delicate and slow process.</description></item><item><title>SoC: Some statistics</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/08/soc-some-statistics.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2007 12:24:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/08/soc-some-statistics.html</guid><description>Here go some statistics about what has been done during the SoC 2007 program as regards ATF:
The repository weights at 293 revisions, 1,174 certificates (typically 4 per revision, but some revisions have more) and 221 files. This includes ATF, the patches to merge it into the NetBSD build tree and the website sources. (mtn db info will give you some more interesting details.)
The clean sources of ATF 0.1 (not counting the files generated by the GNU autotools) take 948Kb and are 20,607 lines long (wow!</description></item><item><title>SoC: ATF 0.1 released</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/08/soc-atf-01-released.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Aug 2007 08:03:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/08/soc-atf-01-released.html</guid><description>To conclude the development of ATF as part of SoC, I've released a 0.1 version coinciding with the coding deadline (later today). This clearly draws a line between what has been done during the SoC program and what will be done afterwards.
See the official announcement for more details!
I hope you enjoy it as much as I did working on it.</description></item><item><title>SoC: Status report</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/08/soc-status-report_15.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Aug 2007 13:43:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/08/soc-status-report_15.html</guid><description>SoC's deadline is just five days away! I'm quite happy with the status of my project, ATF, but it will require a lot more work to be in a decent shape — i.e. ready to be imported into NetBSD — and there really is no time to get it done in five days. Furthermore, it is still to unstable (in the sense that it changes a lot) so importing it right now could cause a lot of grief to end users.</description></item><item><title>SoC: First preview of NetBSD with ATF</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/08/soc-first-preview-of-netbsd-with-atf.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Aug 2007 06:44:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/08/soc-first-preview-of-netbsd-with-atf.html</guid><description>Reposting from the original ATF news entry:
I have just uploaded some NetBSD-current release builds with ATF merged in. These will ease testing to the casual user who is interested in this project because he will not need to mess with patches to the NetBSD source tree nor rebuild a full release, which is a delicate and slow process. For the best experience, these releases are meant to be installed from scratch even though you can also do an upgrade of a current installation.</description></item><item><title>SoC: Status report</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/07/soc-status-report_28.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jul 2007 04:07:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/07/soc-status-report_28.html</guid><description>It has already been a week since the last SoC-related post, so I owe you an status report.
Development has continued at a constant rate and, despite I work a lot on the project, it may seem to advance slowly from an external point of view. The thing is that getting the ATF core components complete and right is a tough job! Just look at the current and incomplete TODO list to see what I mean.</description></item><item><title>SoC: ATF self-testing</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/07/soc-atf-self-testing.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jul 2007 10:52:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/07/soc-atf-self-testing.html</guid><description>ATF is a program, and as happens with any application, it must be (automatically) tested to ensure it works according to its specifications. But as you already know, ATF is a testing framework so... is it possible to automatically test it? Can it test itself? Should it do it? The thing is: it can and it should, but things are not so simple.
ATF can test itself because it is possible to define test programs through ATF to check the ATF tools and libraries.</description></item><item><title>SoC: Web site for ATF</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/07/soc-web-site-for-atf.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2007 05:01:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/07/soc-web-site-for-atf.html</guid><description>While waiting for a NetBSD release build to finish, I've prepared the web site for ATF. It currently lacks information in a lot of areas, but the most important ones for now &amp;mdash; the RSS feed for news and the Repository page &amp;mdash; are quite complete.
Hope you like it! Comments welcome, of course :-)</description></item></channel></rss>
