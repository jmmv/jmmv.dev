      <description>Some days ago, Intel announced a new version of their C++ and Fortran compilers. According to their announcement:
Application performance is also accelerated by multi-core processors through the use of multiple threads.So... as far as I understand, and as some other news sites mention, this means that the compiler tries to automatically parallelize a program by creating multiple threads; the code executed on each thread is decided at build time through some algorithm that deduces which blocks of code can be executed at the same time.</description>

      <title>Flattening an array of arrays</title>

      <description>This evening a friend asked me if I knew how to easily flatten an array of arrays (AoA from now on) in Perl 5. What that means is, basically, to construct a single array that contains the concatenation of all the arrays inside the AoA.
My first answer was: &#34;foldr&#34;, but I knew beforehand that he wouldn&#39;t like it because... this is Haskell. After some time we got to the conclusion that there is no trivial way to flatten an AoA in Perl 5, even though Perl 6 includes a built-in function to do so.</description>

      <title>A split function in Haskell</title>

      <description>Splitting a string into parts based on a token delimiter is a very common operation in some problem domains. Languages such as Perl or Java provide a split function in their standard library to execute this algorithm, yet I&amp;rsquo;m often surprised to see how many languages do not have one. As far as I can tell neither C++ nor Haskell have it so I have coded such a function in the past multiple times in both languages.</description>
