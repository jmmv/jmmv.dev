&lt;p>But uh&amp;hellip; wait, what is Kyua and why is this exciting? To resolve confusion and celebrate this milestone, I&amp;rsquo;d like to revisit what Kyua is, how it came to be, why I stopped working on it for a while, why that was a problem for FreeBSD&amp;mdash;and, indirectly, NetBSD&amp;mdash;and how Kyua being free software has helped keep it alive.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-08-02-kyua-graduates.jpg" length="367311" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Speeding up autoconf with caching</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/06/autoconf-caching.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 06:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/06/autoconf-caching.html</guid><description>&lt;p>In the recent &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2022/05/remembering-buildtool.html">Remembering Buildtool&lt;/a> post, I described how setting up a cache of configuration checks was an important step in Buildtool&amp;rsquo;s installation process. The goal was to avoid pointless repetitive work on every build by performing such common checks once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.bsdnow.tv/457">Episode 457 of BSD Now&lt;/a> featured my post and Allan Jude wondered how much time would be saved in a bulk build of all FreeBSD packages if we could just do that same kind of caching with GNU Autoconf. And, you know what? It is indeed possible to do so. I had mentioned it en passing in my post but I guess I wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear enough, so let&amp;rsquo;s elaborate!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>pkgdb belongs in libdata, not var</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/pkgdb-libdata-var.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2020 08:55:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/pkgdb-libdata-var.html</guid><description>The pkgsrc package database, which by default lives in /var/db/pkg/, should not be there. Instead, it should be under /usr/pkg/libdata/pkgdb/. The same applies to FreeBSD&amp;rsquo;s and OpenBSD&amp;rsquo;s ports and also Debian&amp;rsquo;s dpkg, but I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on pkgsrc because it&amp;rsquo;s the system I know best. Let&amp;rsquo;s see why the current default is suboptimal and why libdata is a good alternative.</description></item><item><title>rc.d belongs in libexec, not etc</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/rcd-libexec-etc.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 06:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/rcd-libexec-etc.html</guid><description>The scripts that live under /etc/rc.d/ in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD are in the wrong place. They all should live in /libexec/rc.d/ because they are code, not configuration. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the history of these systems to see how we got here, why this is problematic, and how things would look like in a better world.</description></item><item><title>A tour of directories as system-wide databases</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/database-directories.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Aug 2020 07:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/database-directories.html</guid><description>In the previous post, we saw how .d directories permit programmatic edits to system-wide configuration with ease.

Uh, WHAT?! Let me explain.
In the beginning...
One of the original but unstated goals of Kyua was to fix the "mess" that is the NetBSD releng test run logs site: if you pay close attention, you will notice that various individuals have reinvented the wheel over and over again in an attempt to automate release builds and test suite runs.</description></item><item><title>BSDCan 2014 summary</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2014/05/bsdcan-2014-summary.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2014 18:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2014/05/bsdcan-2014-summary.html</guid><description>BSDCan 2014 and the accompanying FreeBSD devsummit are officially over. Let's recap.
FreeBSD devsummit
The FreeBSD devsumit at BSDCan is, by far, the largest of them all. It is true that I already visited a devsummit once —the one in EuroBSDCon 2013—, but this is the first time I participate in the "real deal" while also being a committer.
The first impressive thing about this devsummit is that there were about 120 attendees.</description></item><item><title>Killing the ATF deprecated tools code</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2014/02/killing-atf-deprecated-tools-code.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2014 22:11:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2014/02/killing-atf-deprecated-tools-code.html</guid><description>The time to kill the deprecated tools &amp;mdash;atf-report and atf-run principally&amp;mdash; from the upstream ATF distribution file has come. Unfortunately, this is not the trivial task that it may seem.
But wait, "Why?" and "Why now?"
Because NetBSD still relies on the deprecated tools to run its test suite, they cannot just be killed. Removing them from the upstream distribution, however, is actually a good change for both ATF and NetBSD.</description></item><item><title>EuroBSDCon 2013 takeaways</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/eurobsdcon-2013-takeaways.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2013 08:03:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/eurobsdcon-2013-takeaways.html</guid><description>EuroBSDCon 2013 is done. If you have been following my daily posts over the last 4 days (day 1, day 2, day 3 and day 4) as well as #EuroBSDCon updates in Twitter, you may already have a pretty good idea of what went on here. However, with the conference over, it is now a good time to recap the whole event and present the takeaways of these four days which, overall, were quite interesting and productive.</description></item><item><title>Live from EuroBSDCon 2013, day 3</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-3.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2013 12:28:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-3.html</guid><description>Live from Malta today attending the EuroBSDCon 2013 conference. Today is the first day of the conference itself. Many more people have shown up as expected and there have been tons of very interesting talks all the time. It is both good and bad that there are several tracks: you can select the topic you are most interested in, but sometimes great talks overlap!
Keynote
Today's opening session was led by Theo de Raadt, the founder of OpenBSD.</description></item><item><title>Live from EuroBSDCon 2013, day 1</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-1.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2013 12:05:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-1.html</guid><description>Hello everyone! Live from Malta today attending the EuroBSDCon 2013 conference.
Today is the first day out of four: two days of tutorials and two days of actual conference. The tutorials are overlapped by two days of the usual FreeBSD Developer Summit (devsummit for short) and one day of the infrequent NetBSD Developer Summit.
The ambient here is pretty good already: lots of enthusiastic people catching up since the last time they met each other and, more importantly, discussing ongoing developments.</description></item><item><title>Self-interview after leaving the NetBSD board</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/06/self-interview-after-leaving-netbsd.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2013 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/06/self-interview-after-leaving-netbsd.html</guid><description>The decision to not renew my NetBSD board membership was bittersweet.
Let me put aside the Readability series posts for a moment while I recap how the two years serving the NetBSD Board of Directors have been. My term just finished a couple of weeks ago, so it is better to post this while it is still relevant.
First, let me backtrack a little bit. A couple of years ago, I was nominated to serve the NetBSD Board of Directors.</description></item><item><title>Setting up my old Mac Mini G4 as a development machine</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2012/10/setting-up-my-old-mac-mini-g4-as.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2012 15:31:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2012/10/setting-up-my-old-mac-mini-g4-as.html</guid><description>I've spent quite a few time last week setting up my old Mac Mini G4 — a PPC 1.2GHz with 1GB of RAM running NetBSD/macppc current — as a "workstation" for the development of Kyua and other tools for NetBSD. Yes, this machine is very slow, but that's the whole point of the exercise I'm going to narrate below.
I recently got approval from the NetBSD core team to import Kyua into the NetBSD source tree and replace ATF with it.</description></item></channel></rss>
