What you may not know is that, now, it can also achieve this feat on the NetBSD console without using X11 at all. This is done by directly rendering to the wsdisplay framebuffer, and this article presents a crash course on direct graphics and keyboard access via NetBSD&rsquo;s wscons framework.</p><p class=text-muted>January 17, 2025

As I explored my options, I came to the conclusion that NetBSD, the often-forgotten BSD variant, was the best viable choice for my project.</p><p>One reason for this choice is NetBSD&rsquo;s build system. Once you look and get past the fact that it feels frozen in time since 2002, you realize it is still one of the most advanced build systems you can find for an OS. And it shows: the NetBSD build system allows you to build the full OS from scratch, on pretty much any host POSIX platform, while targeting any hardware architecture supported by NetBSD. All without root privileges.</p><p>Another reason for this choice is that NetBSD was my daily workhorse for many years and I&rsquo;m quite familiar with its internals, which is useful knowledge to quickly achieve the goals I have in mind. In fact, I was a NetBSD Developer with capital D: I had commit access to the project from about 2002 through 2012 or so, and I have just revived my account in service of this project. <code>jmmv@</code> is back!</p><p>So, strap onto your seats and let&rsquo;s see how today&rsquo;s NetBSD build system looks like and what makes it special. I&rsquo;ll add my own critique at the end, because it ain&rsquo;t perfect, but overall it continues to deliver on its design goals set in the late 1990s.</p></p><p class=text-muted>December 28, 2024

Yes, this machine is very slow, but that's the whole point of the exercise I'm going to narrate below.<br><br>I recently got approval from the NetBSD core team to import Kyua into the NetBSD source tree and replace ATF with it... which is great, but when thinking about it objectively, I am reluctant to unnecessarily "punish" all NetBSD users by increasing the build time of the system significantly. Don't get me wrong: Kyua itself <i>runs</i>&nbsp;efficiently on old machines, but <i>building</i> the code — particularly the hundreds of tests that come with it — takes just too long. This slowdown is not too noticeable on a relatively-modern machine, but it's unacceptable on not-so-old machines.<br><br>Of course, I could proceed with the import right now (with the code disabled by default) and make it leaner later, but this would cause quite a first bad impression on our users. So it's better to delay the import a little bit until, at least, I have had a chance to simplify some core parts of the code. Mind you, this simplification work is already in progress and quite advanced: it consists on modularizing (as separate processes) some critical parts of the code and writing these with a much simpler style and in plain C.<br><br>But back to the original point of my post.<br><br>The first thing to mention about this experience is that with some effort and long waits, I've got a pretty decent setup for development even on this old machine. From time to time, I miss having a real Unix desktop at hand for development (no OS X, you are not one of those). The GUI behaves relatively well with a 1920x1200 display, running Fluxbox, traditional xterms, Mutt for GMail access and a bunch of other applications.<br><br>Unfortunately, too many things feel really sluggish. A few specific examples:<br><br><ul><li>Firefox 16 is barely usable. I'm not sure there are many alternatives to decent web browsing for such an old non-Intel platform. Dillo is blazing fast and allows me to access online documentation and mailing list archives (just enough for development), but it's pretty much useless for any other purpose given the "Web 2.0".</li><li>Any operation that involves pkgsrc takes ages. Even when building the simplest packages, one can notice the system crawl through all of the pkgsrc infrastructure. Sometimes this is the fault of&nbsp;<a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-changes/2012/10/13/msg079664.html>a bad algorithm</a>; other times it's just sh(1) being the wrong tool for something as complex as pkgsrc internals.</li><li>Things like basic code editing in Emacs 24 are slow at responding to typing. Disabling font lock mode makes it feel fast again, but it's just surprising to see that even color coding is slow.</li></ul>I still remember my old and trusty machine from 10 years ago (a Pentium II 233 MHz): with a similar setup, it was significantly snappier. Yes, software has evolved and these packages now have many more features... but really, does editing a text file have to be sluggish?<div><div><br></div><div>Leaving aside sluggishness, there is also the problem of instability. NetBSD/macppc is a <a href=http://www.netbsd.org/ports/#ports-tier2>tier 2 port</a>, and things don't work as well as one would like. I personally would enjoy bringing this port to tier 1... but I currently lack the time (and basic knowledge of the architecture) to do so :-/</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, the result of this exercise: the new code I'm writing to modularize Kyua builds damn fast in this machine, and keeping it this way is <a href=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/01/02/10252333.aspx>the whole point of having such an old machine as a build environment</a>. So I'll try to keep using it to develop these new components of Kyua.</div></div></p><p class=text-muted>October 22, 2012

That's partly true, but unfortunately is not the whole story:<br><ul><li>Other projects depend on these build files and thus rely on their behavior. This can either be by just relying on NetBSD having these files installed, or by using the separate <tt>mk-files</tt> package (available e.g. in Fedora). The functionality of the build infrastructure should not regress, or it would break these third-party projects. (Think about these files as having a public API outside of NetBSD.)</li><li>Even if the build of NetBSD is the real test of the functionality of the build infrastructure, the build infrastructure supports dozens of options and tweaks to change its behavior. One would need to rebuild NetBSD tens, if not hundreds of times, each with a different combination of build options, to ensure the files work.</li><li>Lastly, when a new functionality is added to the build infrastructure, it is because some component of the source tree needs such functionality. It may latter happen that this component disappears or stops needing such functionality. The functionality becomes unused by the source tree, and thus can regress unexpectedly (breaking third-party packages or introducing bugs, as mentioned earlier).</li></ul>With this in mind, it's clear that we should have some tests for the <tt>share/mk</tt> files. Unfortunately, that's easier said than done:&nbsp;the files in <tt>share/mk</tt> are extremely complex and expose hundreds, if not thousands, of different behaviors each with its own subtleties. Adding tests for these is hard. The fact that this code that was never designed to be unit-tested doesn't help either.<br><div><br>Regardless, I have just&nbsp;<a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/source-changes/2012/08/26/msg036875.html>submitted some "placeholder" tests</a>&nbsp;to the tree. The major point of these new test programs is&nbsp;to lower the barrier of entry to writing tests for <tt>share/mk</tt> and, therefore, maybe get other people to write some tests. To predicate with the example, I have populated these skeleton test programs with a couple of test cases each, although as you will see they are very trivial tests.<br><br>And, to conclude, why have I done this <i>now</i>? Well: I'm working on integrating Kyua into the source tree and, to make this happen, I need to do a couple of changes to the build infrastructure files. The changes are tricky, so I want to write tests to have some assurance that my modifications work and that, specially, they do not regress over time. Having the placeholder test programs in place makes this much easier, and the real functionality changes easier to review.</div></p><p class=text-muted>August 26, 2012

Yeah, this name sounds very pretentious but, really, I don't intend this to be anything big. The only thing I want to do is simplify my life when implementing shell scripts, and hope that other people might find the modules useful. So far, I have taken the generic (and common!) code from sysbuild and sysupgrade, reconciled a few tiny divergences, and moved it into this new shtk package.<br><br class=Apple-interchange-newline>In reality, writing something like shtk is sin-borderline. I really should not be using shell scripting for the kind of tools I am implementing (they deserve better data structures and better error checking than what shell provides, for example). However, shell scripting is incredible convenient to get reasonably-good implementations of such tools with minimal effort, and is the only scripting language available in NetBSD's base system. (Yes, yes, there is Lua, but my limited knowledge of Lua would not let me write these tools in any decent manner nor in any reasonable time.)<br><div><br></div>So, what's in shtk? There are a few functions to deal with command lines (error/warning reporting and such things), some trivial stuff to deal with lists, a bunch of code to interact with cvs and, what I like the most, a module to implement configuration files with some kind of key/value validation.<br><br>At the moment, shtk can only be found in pkgsrc under <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/devel/shtk?only_with_tag=MAIN">pkgsrc/devel/shtk</a>&nbsp;and I don't currently have any plans to make it more widely available. If there are enough people interested in that with real needs, I could reconsider, but the maintenance effort would be non-trivial.<br><br>To showcase the features of shtk, I have updated the sysbuild and sysupgrade packages to depend on this new toolkit while at the same time dropping all this duplicate supporting code. It's a good thing that I wrote exhaustive tests for all possible code paths, because the migration from the built-in modules to shtk was riddled with subtleties that would have impacted end users otherwise.<br><br>Now... time to really consider taking the task of rewriting pkg_comp in a more&nbsp;maintainable&nbsp;style so that I can add the features I have wished for for many years (like OS X support).</p><p class=text-muted>August 15, 2012

But what fun is that if you have no trivial way of upgrading your existing NetBSD installation to a newer version?<br><br>Upgrading NetBSD to a newer version from distribution sets generally looks like the following;<br><ol><li>Fetch new distribution sets (or roll your own).</li><li>Upgrade the kernel.</li><li>Unpack the distribution sets over the root directory, without fat-fingering the command and unpacking <tt>etc.tgz</tt> along the way.</li><li>Use <tt>etcupdate</tt> to merge new changes to configuration files.</li><li>Use <tt>postinstall</tt> to validate the upgraded system.</li></ol><b>Simple? Yes. Easy? No.</b> The above procedure is obscure to anyone new to NetBSD. (Actually, if you tell anybody that the way to upgrade your machine is by unpacking tarballs over <tt>/</tt> will stare at you thinking you are kidding. It's 2012.) "Jokes" aside, what is worse is that the procedure is quite monotonous and, therefore, it is very easy for the administrator to make a trivial mistake along the way and screw up a running system. (Been there, done that... multiple times.)<br><br>Machines are made to automate trivial and repetitive tasks like the above, and they are actually very good at that. Over the years, I have performed NetBSD updates manually and later written crappy, unreliable scripts to do the upgrades for me. These scripts have never been reusable and they haven't dealt with error conditions gracefully. Furthermore, because these scripts live in my home directory, I have to remember to carry them around every time I set up a new NetBSD box.<br><br>It was about time I sat down and rewrote my custom scripts into something more "decent". Something with documentation, with a configuration file, and with tests.<br><br>So today, and for all the reason above, I am <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-changes/2012/08/06/msg076544.html>introducing sysupgrade</a>.<br><br>sysupgrade is a script that automates (trivializes) the whole process of upgrading an existing NetBSD installation to a newer release,&nbsp;be it the currently-running system or a non-live system. sysupgrade does so by following the steps outlined above and is coordinated by a configuration file. You can find the tool in <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/sysutils/sysupgrade/?only_with_tag=MAIN"><span id=goog_1890316919></span>pkgsrc/sysutils/sysupgrade<span id=goog_1890316920></span></a>, next to sysbuild. The bundled <tt>sysupgrade(8)</tt> and <tt>sysupgrade.conf(5)</tt> manual pages, and the default <tt>sysupgrade.conf</tt> configuration file should get you started and hopefully answer most of your questions.<br><br>For the impatient, the following command would upgrade your machine to the specified version target:<br><br><tt>$ sysupgrade auto</tt><br><tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-&lt;X.Y.Z>/$(uname -m)</tt><br><br>At the moment, please consider sysupgrade to be experimental. It works well for me on my various machines (running both NetBSD 6.0 BETA and -current), and I have been using the upgrade procedure outlined above for years without issues. However, as with any shiny-new software, be careful. If you use NetBSD on a virtual machine, take a snapshot before running this tool; I don't think your machine is going to blow up, but better safe than sorry!<br><br>Enjoy, and feedback very welcome!<br><br>PS: There is lots of room for improvement. The <tt>TODO</tt> file in the package directory includes some of the ideas I'd like to work on later.</p><p class=text-muted>August 6, 2012

I initially went the easy route by putting the data in my laptop, which already uses FileVault 2 to encrypt the whole disk. But soon after, I decided that it would be nicer to put this data in my NetBSD home server, which is the machine that is perpetually connected to IRC and thus the one I use to log into the weekly meetings.<br><br>At that point, I was faced with the "challenge" to set up an encrypted volume under NetBSD. I knew of the existence of <i>cgd(4): cryptographic disk driver</i>&nbsp;but had never used it. It really is not that hard, but there are a bunch of manual steps involved so I've been meaning to document them for almost a year already.<br><br>Because my home server is a NetBSD/macppc and reinstalling the system is quite a nightmare, I did not want to go through the hassle of repartitioning the disk just to have an encrypted partition of 1GB. The choice was to create a disk image instead, store it in <tt>/secure.img</tt> and mount it on <tt>/secure</tt>. Let's see how to do this.<br><br>The first step is to create the disk image itself and "loop-mount" it (in Linux terms). We do this the traditional way, by creating an empty file and setting up a <i>vnd(4): vnode disk driver</i> device to access it:<br><pre># dd if=/dev/zero of=/secure.img bs=1m count=1024<br># vnconfig -c /dev/vnd2 /secure.img</pre>The next step is to configure a new cgd(4) device. This block-level device is a layer placed on top of a regular storage device, and is in charge of encrypting the data to the lower-level device transparently. cgdconfig(8), the tool used to configure cgd(4) devices, stores control information on a device basis under <tt>/etc/cgd/</tt>. The control information can be generated as follows:<br><pre># cgdconfig -g -o /etc/cgd/vnd2c aes-cbc 192</pre>This creates the <tt>/etc/cgd/vnd2c</tt> configuration file, which you can choose to inspect now. With the file in place, configuring the cryptographic device for the first time is easy:<br><pre># cgdconfig cgd0 /dev/vnd2c</pre>This command will inspect the underlying <tt>/dev/vnd2c</tt> device looking for a signature indicating that the volume is valid and already encrypted. Because the volume is still empty, the tool will proceed to ask us for an encryption key to initialize the volume. We enter our key, wait a couple of seconds, and <tt>/dev/cgd0</tt> will be ready to be used as a regular disk device. With that in mind, we can proceed to create a new file system and mount it on the desired location:<br><pre># newfs -O 2 /dev/rcgd0c<br># mkdir /secure<br># mount /dev/cgd0c /secure</pre>To simplify access to the device for your users, I did something like this:<br><pre># user=your-user-name<br># mkdir /secure/${user}<br># chown ${user}:users /secure/${user}<br># chmod 700 /secure/${user}<br># ln -s /home/${user}/secure /secure/${user}</pre>And we are done. Now, depending on the situation, we could choose to get <tt>/secure</tt> automatically mounted during boot, but that would involve having to type the decryption key. This is OK for a laptop, but not for a headless home server. Because I don't really need to have this secure device mounted all the time, I have the following script in <tt>/root/secure.sh</tt> that I can use to mount and unmount the device at will:<br><pre>#! /bin/sh<br><br>set -e -x<br><br>case "${1:-mount}" in<br>mount)<br>    vnconfig -c /dev/vnd2 /secure.img<br>    cgdconfig cgd0 /dev/vnd2c<br>    fsck -y /dev/cgd0c<br>    mount /dev/cgd0c /secure<br>    ;;<br>unmount)<br>    umount /secure<br>    cgdconfig -u cgd0<br>    vnconfig -u /dev/vnd2<br>    ;;<br>esac</pre>Be aware that cgdconfig(1) has many more options! Take a look at the manual page and choose the ones that best suit your use case.<br><br>Random idea: instead of using a vnd(4) device, plug in a USB stick and use that instead for your secure data! &nbsp;(I actually do this too to back up sensitive information like private keys.)</p><p class=text-muted>February 17, 2012

After the Nomination&nbsp;Committee made their way through the long list of nominees, interviews and deliberation, they proposed a slate for the new members of the board. This slate included two people who were renewing their previous term (tron@ and reed@) and two new members (spz@ and jmmv@) to replace the two members stepping down (agc@ and david@). The final approval of the proposed slate happened in April 2011 and, yesterday, it became official.<br><br>Looking back, I can't believe it has been already ~10 years since I first started using NetBSD. Ah, those were the times of 1.5. My responsibilities within the project have shifted a lot during this time, ranging from the maintenance of GNOME and several web site tasks, the development of the testing framework (which is still ongoing today), and, from today, to my new duties within the board.<br><br>I'm looking forward to working on this new area of the project and I hope to meet the requirements of such position. The two members being replaced will be missed, and keeping up to the high bar they left behind will be tough. That said, I hope spz@ and I will be able to meet the expectations.<br><br>If you have any ideas or concerns regarding the direction of <a href=http://www.netbsd.org/>The NetBSD Project</a>, don't hesitate to send them to the board@!</p><p class=text-muted>May 22, 2011

I actually didn't, but I just came across the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bit>Sticky bit page</a> on Wikipedia through <a href=http://twitter.com/#!/aarontoponce/status/17003438298636288>a tweet</a> from <a href=http://twitter.com/#!/AaronToponce>@AaronToponce</a> and discovered why.<div><br></div><div>If you have used any "recent" (the quotes are important) Unix-like system, you probably know what the sticky bit is used for: to restrict the deletion of files in a directory to, basically, the owner of such files. The sticky bit is used on <tt>/tmp</tt> (among other directories) so that anyone can create temporary files in it but only those that created the temporary files can delete them.</div><div><br></div><div>But that's not all that is to know.</div><div><br></div><div>The original purpose of the sticky bit was to <i>mark frequently-used executable files so that the operating system kept their text segment on swap space</i>. This speeded up subsequent executions of such programs because the system would not need to access the file system to load the binary: it could just use the image already kept in the swap space. This behavior became obsolete with the advent of memory-mapped executables.</div><div><br></div><div>Now it's clear why the sticky bit has the name it has, isn't it? But still, that's not all that is to know.</div><div><br></div><div>SunOS 4 introduced a new behavior for the sticky bit on regular, non-executable files: reads and writes to such files would bypass the buffer cache, thus basically telling the system to perform raw I/O on those files.

I have just realized that I have not blogged at all about the project that has kept me busy for the past two months! Not good, not good. "What is this project?", I hear. Well, this project is <a href=http://code.google.com/p/kyua/>Kyua</a>.<br><br>A bit of background first: the <a href=http://www.NetBSD.org/~jmmv/atf/>Automated Testing Framework</a>, or ATF for short, is a project that I <a href=/2007/04/soc-selected-again.html>started during the Summer of Code of 2007</a>. The major goal of ATF was, and still is, to provide a testing framework for the <a href=http://www.NetBSD.org/>NetBSD</a> operating system. The ATF framework is composed of a set of libraries to aid in the implementation of test cases in C, C++ and shell, and a set of tools to ease the execution of such test cases (<tt>atf-run</tt>) and to generate <a href=http://www.gson.org/netbsd/bugs/build/build/2010.12.14.20.09.43/test.html>reports</a> of the execution (<tt>atf-report</tt>).<br><br>At that point in time, I would say that the original design of ATF was nice. It made test programs intelligent enough to execute their test cases in a sandboxed environment. Such test programs could be executed on their own (without <tt>atf-run</tt>) and they exposed the same behavior as when they were run within the runtime monitor, <tt>atf-run</tt>. On paper this was nice, but in practice it has become a hassle. Additionally, some of these design decisions mean that particular features (in particular, parallel execution of tests) cannot be implemented at all. At the end of 2009 and beginning of 2010, I did some <a href=/2010/03/introducing-atf-nofork-branch.html>major refactorings</a> to the code to make the test programs dumber and to move much of the common logic into <tt>atf-run</tt>, which helped a lot in fixing the major shortcomings encountered by the users... but the result is that, today, we have a huge mess.<br><br>Additionally, while ATF is composed of different modules conceptually separate from each other, there is some hard implementation couplings among them that impose severe restrictions during development. Tangentially, during the past 2 years of working at Google (and coding mainly in Python), I have been learning new neat programming techniques to make code more testable... and these are not followed at all by ATF. In fact, while the test suite of ATF seems very extensive, it definitely is not: there are many corner cases that are not tested and for which implementing tests would be <i>very</i> hard (which means that nasty bugs have easily sneaked in into releases).<br><br>Lastly, a very important point that affects directly the success of the project. Outsiders that want to contribute to ATF have a huge entry barrier: the source repository is managed by <a href=http://www.monotone.ca/>Monotone</a>, the bug tracker is provided by Gnats (a truly user-unfriendly system), and the mailing lists are offered by majordomo. None of these tools is "standard" by today's common practices, and some of them are tied to NetBSD's hosting which puts some outsiders off.<br><br>For all the reasons above and as this year has been moving along, I have gotten fed up with the ATF code base. (OK, things are not <i>that</i> bad... but in my mind they do ;-) And here is where Kyua comes into the game.<br><br><a href=http://code.google.com/p/kyua/>Kyua</a> is a project to address all the shortcomings listed above. First of all, the project uses off-the-shelf development tools that should make it much, much easier for external people to contribute. Secondly, the project intends to be much more modular, providing a clear separation between the different components and providing code that is easily testable. Lastly, Kyua intends to remain compatible with ATF so that there are no major disruptions for users. You can (and should) think of Kyua as ATF 2.0, not as a vastly different framework.<br><br>As of today, Kyua implements a runtime engine that is on par, feature-wise, to the one provided by <tt>atf-run</tt>. It is able to run test cases implemented with the ATF libraries and it is able to test itself. It currently contains 355 test cases that run in less than 20 seconds. (Compare that to the 536 test cases of ATF, which take over a minute to run, and Kyua is still really far from catching up with all the functionality of ATF.) Next actions involve implementing reports generation and configuration files.<br><br>Anyway. For more details on the project, I recommend you to read the <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/atf-devel/2010/11/13/msg000206.html>original posting to atf-devel</a> or the project's <a href=http://code.google.com/p/kyua/>main page</a> and <a href=http://code.google.com/p/kyua/w/list>wiki</a>. And of course, you can also download the preliminary source code to take a look!<br><br>Enjoy :-)</p><p class=text-muted>December 16, 2010

This library provides an interface to asynchronously wait for file system change notifications including the creation, deletion and modification of files.<br><br>The monitoring functionality in GIO is modular: it is backed by different loadable plugins that implement OS-specific functionality. In particular, GIO uses an inotify module in Linux and a <a href=http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/>FAM</a> module everywhere else.<br><br>Up until now, the <tt>devel/glib2</tt> package in pkgsrc provided a build-time option to specify whether to build the GIO FAM plugin or not. Given that this plugin is built as a shared object that is loaded dynamically at run-time, having a build-time option for this is clearly wrong: it gives no choice to those relying on binary packages (e.g. end/new users). Furthermore, it adds a dependency on the ugly-FAM at the very bottom of the huge Gnome dependency chain. (As already stated, FAM is outdated and hard to set up.)<br><br>So, based on this, I've just removed all FAM support from <tt>devel/glib2</tt> altogether and packaged its loadable module as <tt>sysutils/gio-fam</tt>.<br><br>Now waiting for a clean rebuild of the Gnome packages to see if the desktop now works on my machine by avoiding FAM/Gamin.</p><p class=text-muted>April 20, 2010

While NetBSD has surprised me in a good way (I am running it on a Macbook Pro and things like wireless and DRI work), Gnome has not. There are tons of broken things that prevent a smooth user experience.<br><br>One of these broken things is the monitoring of changes in the file system. Actually, this has never worked 100%. But what is this and why does it matter, you ask? Well, file system monitoring is an internal component of the Gnome infrastructure that allows the desktop to receive notifications when files or directories change. This way, if, say, you are viewing the Downloads folder in Nautilus and you start downloading a file from Epiphany into that folder, Nautilus will realize the new file and show it immediately without requiring a manual refresh.<br><br>How to monitor the file system depends on the operating system. There are basically two approaches: polling and asynchronous notifications. Polling is suboptimal because the notifications are usually delayed. Asynchronous notifications are tied to the operating system: Linux provides <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify>inotify</a>, NetBSD provides <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue>kqueue</a> and other systems provide their own APIs.<span style=display:block id=formatbar_Buttons><span class="on down" style=display:block id=formatbar_CreateLink title=Link onmouseover=ButtonHoverOn(this) onmouseout=ButtonHoverOff(this) onmousedown='CheckFormatting(event),FormatbarButton("richeditorframe",this,8),ButtonMouseDown(this)'><img src=/images/2010-04-20-blank.gif alt=Link class=gl_link border=0></span></span><br>In the past, Gnome monitored the file system by a combination of <a href=http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/>FAM</a>, a system-level service that provides an API to file system monitoring, and GNOME VFS, a high-level layer that hides the interaction with FAM. This approach was good in spirit (client/server separation) but didn't work well:<br><ul><li>FAM is abandoned.<br></li><li>Does not support kqueue out of the box.</li><li>FAM runs as root.<br></li><li>FAM is too hard to set up: it requires rpcbind, an addition to <tt>/etc/services</tt>, a sysctl tweak, and the configuration of a system-level daemon.</li></ul>To solve some of these problems, a drop-in replacement for FAM was started. <a href=http://people.gnome.org/%7Eveillard/gamin/>Gamin</a>, as it is known, still does not fix everything:<br><ul><li>Gamin is abandoned.</li><li>Supports kqueue out of the box, but does not work very well.</li><li>Actually, Gamin itself does not work. Running the tests provided by the distfile in a modern Linux system results in several test failures.<br></li></ul>Anyway. Did you notice the <span style=font-style:italic>abandoned</span> pattern above? This is important: in the new world order, Gnome does not use FAM any more.<br><br>The new structure to monitor files is: the low-level glib library provides the gio module, which has some file system monitoring APIs. The GVFS module provides higher level abstractions to file system management, and relies on gio for file system monitoring. There is no more GNOME VFS any more.<br><br>The <span style=font-style:italic>key</span> point is: gio uses inotify directly; no abstraction layers in between. FAM support is still there for platforms without inotify, but as it is not used in Linux any more, it rots. Linux developers will never experience what it is to have a system that needs to use FAM to get this functionality to work.<br><br>At last, let's look at the status of all this in NetBSD:<br><ul><li>The FAM package was <a href=/2004/10/fam-and-kqueue.html>patched to support kqueue</a>. Although this kinda works, it is not perfect. Also, as mentioned above, FAM is, I'd say, the package with the hardest installation procedure of the whole Gnome platform.<br></li><li>The Gamin packages are nicer than the FAM package regarding their configuration. However, when using Gamin instead of FAM, all sorts of bugs appear in Gnome (it actually gets stuck during startup for me). The breakage of the unit tests does not provide any confidence, and the fact that Gamin is abandoned, the idea of fixing it doesn't make me thrive.</li><li>The glib2 package <span style=font-style:italic>depends</span> on FAM. This is ugly; really ugly. I had to shout WTF when I saw this, seriously.</li><li>Seeing the direction gio/gvfs take, it is obvious that things can only get worse in the future.<br></li></ul>If time permits, I'm planning to work on improving this whole situation. Ideas include:<br><ul><li>Splitting the FAM gio module out of the glib2 package. Ideally, this would happen upstream.</li><li>Implement a gio backend for kqueue.</li><li>Check if the core packages still using gnome-vfs have a more recent version that uses gvfs instead and, if so, update them.<br></li></ul>Can't promise you anything other than, if I get to work on it, I will keep you posted!</p><p class=text-muted>April 20, 2010

The process wasn't easy, as it involved the following steps. I'm omitting many details, as they are "common knowledge" to Mac users (or otherwise can be easily found on the net):<br><ul><li>After booting the installer from the CD image, drop into the shell.</li><li>Use <tt>pdisk</tt> to create an <tt>Apple_HFS</tt> partition for the boot loader and two <tt>Apple_UNIX_SVR2</tt> partitions, one for the root file system and another for swap.</li><li>Run <tt>sysinst</tt> and install the system. When asked to repartition the disk, just say <i>Use existing partition sizes</i>.</li><li>Once the system is installed, drop again into the shell before rebooting.</li><li>Mount your hard disk into <tt>/mnt</tt> and chroot into it.</li><li>Fetch a copy of pkgsrc.</li><li>Install the <tt>sysutils/hfsutils</tt> package.</li><li>Use <tt>hformat</tt> to create a new HFS file system in the <tt>Apple_HFS</tt> partition we created.</li><li>Mount the installation CD.</li><li>Copy, using <tt>hcopy</tt>, the <tt>ofwboot.xcf</tt> file from the CD to the boot partition.</li><li>Reboot.</li><li>Drop into the OpenFirmware setup (Command+Option+P+R).</li><li>Set <tt>boot-device</tt> to <tt>hd:,ofwboot.xcf</tt>.</li><li>Set <tt>boot-file</tt> to <tt>netbsd</tt>.</li><li>And here is the tricky thing to get the machine to auto-boot: Set <tt>boot-command</tt> to <tt>." hello" cr " screen" output boot</tt>, not <tt>mac-boot</tt>.</li></ul><div>I found the last command somewhere on the Internet (dunno where now), but, supposedly, a regular <tt>mac-boot</tt> should have worked. In fact, it works if you call this command from the prompt, but not during automatic boot. (It turns out to be a problem with the version of OpenFirmware I have.)</div><div><br></div><div>Just writing down the steps in case I need them later on. Installing Debian stable was much, much easier, but the installer for testing crashes every day with a different error, so I gave up.</div><div><br></div><div>(Oh, by the way, I did the same installation into an old PowerMac G3 and that was really painful. The machine refused to boot from any of the CDs I tried and the prebuilt kernels hang during initialization due to a bogus driver. In the end: netbooting and using custom kernels.)</div></p><p class=text-muted>January 11, 2010

There is a problem in one of the uhci/ehci, bge or azalia drivers that causes a lockup at boot time because of a shared interrupt problem. Disabling ehci or azalia from the kernel lets the machine boot. In order to do that, there are two options: either you rebuild your kernel without the offending driver, or you boot into the userconf prompt with -c and, from there, manually disable the driver at each boot. None of the options are quite convincing.<br><br>Of course, disabling a faulty driver is not the correct solution, but the workaround is useful on its own. I've just added a <tt>userconf</tt> command to the boot loader and its configuration file -- <tt>/boot</tt> and <tt>/boot.cfg</tt> respectively -- so that the end user can pass random userconf commands to the kernel in an automated way. userconf is a kernel feature that lets you change the parameters of builtin drivers and enable/disable them before the hardware detection routines are run.<br><br>With this new feature in the boot loader, you can customize a GENERIC kernel without having to rebuild it! Yes, modules could help here too, but we are not there yet for hardware drivers. Note that OpenBSD has had a similar feature for a while with <tt>config -e</tt>, but they actually modify the kernel binary.<br><br>You can check the patch out and comment about it in <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2009/01/22/msg004081.html>my post to tech-kern</a>.</p><p class=text-muted>January 22, 2009

This is causing all sorts of trouble, and a problem I found yesterday was that, after a clean install of NetBSD/amd64, it was impossible to change the data of any user through chfn. The command failed with:<br><br><tt>chfn: /etc/master.passwd: entry root inconsistent expire<br>chfn: /etc/master.passwd: unchanged</tt><br><br>Suspiciously, the data presented by chfn showed an expiration date for root set in a seemingly-random day (October 14th, 2021). That seemed like some part of the system not parsing the user database correctly and generating random values. A sample test program that walked through the passwords database with <tt>getpwent(3)</tt> showed an invalid expiration date for root, even when <tt>/etc/master.passwd</tt> had a 0 in that field.<br><br>After some debugging, I found out that libc tries to be compatible with old-format binary password databases (those generated by pwd_mkdb). In order to deal with compatibility, libc checks to see if the database has a VERSION field set in it. If not, it assumes it is an old version and thus time_t may not be 64-bit. If the VERSION field is set, it uses the new time_t.<br><br>So what was the problem? pwd_mkdb did not set the VERSION field even though it wrote a new-format database. libc assumed it was laid out according to the old format but it was not, so it got garbage data during parsing. After some hacking, I fixed it as described <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/current-users/2009/01/14/msg007274.html>in a post to current-users</a>.<br><br>Soon after, Christos Zoulas (the one who did all the time_t work) told me that he had already done these changes in his branch but forgot to merge them. He did now, and the code in the main branch should work fine. I still think there is a <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/current-users/2009/01/15/msg007292.html>minor problem</a> in it, but the major issue after installation should be gone.</p><p class=text-muted>January 15, 2009

To test that, I attempted to load the puffs module and failed with an error message saying something like "kobj_reloc: unexpected relocation type 1". Similarly, the same error appeared when running the simpler regression tests in /usr/tests/modules.<br><br>After seeing that error message, I tracked it down in the source code and ended in src/sys/arch/arm/arm32/kobj_machdep.c. A quick look at it and at src/sys/arch/arm/include/elf_machdep.h revealed that the kernel was lacking support for the R_ARM_PC24 relocation type. "It can't be too difficult to implement", I thought. Hah!<br><br>Based on documentation, I understood that R_ARM_PC24 is used in "short" jumps. This relocation is used to signal the runtime system that the offset to the target address of a branch instruction has to be relocated. This offset is a 24-bit number and, when loaded, it has to be shifted two bits to the left to accommodate for the fact that instructions are 32-bit aligned. Before the relocation, there is some addend encoded in the instruction that has to be loaded, sign-extended and shifted two bits to the left and, after all that, added to the calculated address.<br><br>I spent hours trying to implement support for the R_ARM_PC24 relocation type because it didn't want to work as expected. I even ended up looking at the Linux code to see how they dealt with it, and I found out that I was doing exactly the same as them. So what was the problem? A while later I realized that this whole thing wasn't working because the relocated address to be stored in the branch instruction didn't fit in the 24 bits! That makes things harder to solve.<br><br>At that point, I looked at the port-arm mailing list and found that several <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-arm/2008/12/19/msg000580.html>other people were looking at this same issue</a>. Great, some time "wasted" but a lot of new stuff learnt. Anyway, it turns out there are basically two solutions to the problem described above. The first involves generating jump trampolines for the addresses that fall too far away. The second one is simpler: just change the kernel to load the modules closer to the kernel text, and thus make the jump offsets fit into the 24 bits of the instructions. Effectively, there is a guy that has got <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-arm/2009/01/01/msg000606.html>almost everything working</a> already.<br><br>Let's see if they can get it working soon!</p><p class=text-muted>January 2, 2009

If you are looking for some interesting idea to apply for, this is a good one! Why?<br><ul><li>It will let you get into NetBSD internals in almost all areas of the system: you'll need to understand how the source tree is organized, how to add new components to it (because tests are almost in all aspects regular programs), how the current pieces of the system interact with each other...<br></li><li>You will need to gain knowledge in some areas (such as the kernel or the libraries) to be able to port tests from the old framework (if it deserves that name ;-) to the new one and, if you are really up to it, even add new tests for functionality that is currently uncovered by the test suite.

Having a public test suite with high coverage means that the system will gain quality. Yes, you will most likely uncover bugs in many areas of the system and give them enough exposure so that someone else may fix them.</li></ul>Note that this project is really a Summer of <i>Code</i> project. It does not have a long design phase on its own so, once you have got used to the system and ATF, you'll just code and immediately make useful contributions.

Hah!<div><br></div><div>What I did first was to implement this feature for C++ test programs and added tests for it.  So far, so good.  It effectively was easy to do: just program an alarm in the test program driver and, when it fires, kill the subprocess that is executing the current test case. Then log an appropriate error message.</div><div><br></div><div>The tests for this feature deserve some explanation.  What I do is: program a timeout and then make the test case's body sleep for a period of time.  I try different values for the two timers and if the timeout is smaller than the sleeping period, then the test must fail or otherwise there is a problem.</div><div><br></div><div>The next step was to implement this in the shell interface, and this is where things got tricky.  I did a quick and dirty implementation, and it seemed to make the same tests I added for the C++ interface pass.  However, when running the bootstrap testsuite, it got stalled at the cleanup part.  Upon further investigation, I noticed that there were quite a lot of sleep(1) processes running when the testsuite was stalled, and killing them explicitly let the process continue.  You probably noticed were the problem was already.</div><div><br></div><div>When writing a shell program, you are forking and executing external utilities constantly, and sleep(1) is one of them.  It turns out that in my specific test case, the shell interpreter is just waiting for the sleep subprocess to finish (whereas in the C++ version everything happens in a single process).  And, <span class=Apple-style-span style=font-style:italic>killing a process does not kill its children</span>.  There you go.  My driver was just killing the main process of the test case, but not everything else that was running; hence, it did not die as expected, and things got stalled until the subprocesses also died.</div><div><br></div><div>Solving this was the fun part. The only effective way to make this work is to kill the test case's main process <i>and</i>, recursively, all of its children. But killing a tree of processes is not an easy thing to do: there is no system interface to do it, there is no portable interface to get a list of children and I'm yet unsure if this can be done without race conditions.  I reserve the explanation of the recursive-kill algorithm I'm using for a future post.</div><div><br></div><div>After some days of work, I've got this working under Mac OS X and also have got automated tests to ensure that it effectively works (which were the hardest part by far).  But as I foresaw, it fails miserably under NetBSD: the build was broken, which was easy to fix, but now it also fails at runtime, something that I have not diagnosed yet. Aah, the joys of Unix...<br></div></p><p class=text-muted>January 15, 2008

Let's explain.<br><br>Yesterday, for some unknown reason, I ended up running id(1) with two different user names as its arguments. Mysteriously, I only got the details for the first user back and no error for the second one. After looking at the manual page and what the GNU implementation did, I realized that the command is only supposed to take a single user or none at all as part of its arguments.<br><br>OK, so "let's add a simple <tt>argc</tt> check to the code and raise the appropriate error when it is greater than 2". Yeah, right. If you look at id(1)'s main routine, you'll find an undecipherable piece of spaghetti code &mdash; have you ever thought about adding multiple <tt>?flag</tt> variables and checking the result of the sum? &mdash; that comes from the fact that id(1)'s code is shared across three different programs: id(1), groups(1) and whoami(1).<br><br>After spending some time trying to understand the rationale behind the code, I concluded that I could not safely fix the problem as easily as I first thought. And, most likely, touching the logic in there would most likely result in a regression somewhere else, basically because id(1) has multiple primary, mutually-exclusive options and groups(1) and whoami(1) are supposed to have their own syntax. Same unsafety as for refactoring it.<br><br>So what did I do? Thanks to ATF being already in NetBSD, I spent the day writing tests for all possible usages of the three commands (which was not trivial at all) and, of course, added stronger tests to ensure that the documented command line syntax was enforced by the programs. After that, I was fairly confident that if I changed the code and all the new tests passed afterwards (specially those that did before), I had not broken it. So I did the change only after the tests were done.<br><br>I know it will be hard to "impose" such testing/bug-fixing procedure to other developers, but I would really like them to consider extensive testing... even for obvious changes or for trivial tools such as these ones. You never know when you break something until someone else complains later.</p><p class=text-muted>November 16, 2007

To my disliking, this has been delayed too much... but I was so busy with my PFC that I couldn't find any other chance to get my hands on it.<br><br>I've started by working on two core components:<br><ul><li><span style=font-style:italic>libatf</span>: The C/C++ library that will provide the interface to easily write test cases and test suites. Among its features will be the ability to report the results of each test, a way to define meta-data for each test, etc.<br></li><li><span style=font-style:italic>libatfmain</span>: A library that provides a default entry point for test programs that takes care to run the test cases in a controlled environment &mdash; e.g. it captures all signals and deals with them gracefully &mdash; and provides a standard command-line interface for them.</li></ul>Soon after I started coding, I realized that I could need to write my own C code to deal with data collections and safe strings. I hate that, because that's a very boring task &mdash; it is not related to the problem at hand at all &mdash; and because it involves reinventing the wheel: virtually all other languages provide these two features for-free. But wait! NetBSD has a C++ compiler, and atf won't be a host tool<sup>1</sup>. So... I can take advantage of C++, and I'll try to. Calm down! I'll try to avoid some of the "complex" C++ features as much as possible to keep the executables' size small enough. You know how the binaries' size blows up when using templates... Oh, and by the way: keep in mind that test cases will be typically written in POSIX shell script, so in general you won't need to deal with the C++ interface.<br><br>Furthermore, I see no reason for atf to be tied to NetBSD. The test cases will surely be, but the framework needn't. Thus I'm thinking of creating a standalone package for atf itself and distributing it as a completely independent project (under the TNF<sup>2</sup> umbrella), which will later be imported into the NetBSD source tree as we currently do for other third-party projects such as Postfix. In fact, I've already started work on this direction by creating the typical infrastructure to use the GNU auto-tools. Of course this separation could always be done at a later step in the development, but doing it from the very beginning ensures the code is free of NetBSD-isms, emphasizes the portability desire and keeps the framework self-contained.<br><br>I'd like to hear your comments about these "decisions" :-)<br><br><sup>1</sup> A <span style=font-style:italic>host tool</span> is a utility that is built with the operating system's native tools instead of with the NetBSD's tool-chain: i.e. host tools are what <tt>build.sh tools</tt> builds. Such tools need to be highly portable because they have to be accepted by old compilers and bizarre build environments.<br><br><sup>2</sup> TNF = The NetBSD Foundation.</p><p class=text-muted>June 24, 2007

Keep in mind that the web site is the main "entry point" to a project and newcomers should feel <i>very</i> comfortable with it; otherwise they will go away in less than a minute!<br><br>Furthermore, it'd be nice to see if there are any plain HTML pages left and convert them to XML. This could make all those pages automatically use the new look of the site and integrate better with it. (If you don't know what I mean, just click, for example, on the <a href=http://www.netbsd.org/Gnats/>Report or query a bug</a> at the top of the front page. It looks ugly; very ugly.

The conference started around 1:00pm on the 27th and has lasted until today^Wyesterday (the 29th) at around 7:00pm. There have been <a href=http://www.pkgsrccon.org/2007/presentations.html>10 different talks</a> as planned, although we weren't able to follow the proposed <a href=http://www.pkgsrccon.org/2007/schedule.html>schedule</a>. Most of the presentations were delayed and some were shifted because the speakers could not arrive on time. Not a big deal though.<br><br>We have been, more or less, around 20-25 people. There were 30 registered, but a couple had to withdraw and some others did not come (for unknown reasons to us). Maybe the conferences were too technical or the schedule did not meet their expectations.<br><br>The thing is I originally intended to write a short report after each day, but I have had literally no life outside pkgsrcCon since Thursday night. Taking care of the organization has been time consuming (and I have done almost nothing!), not to mention that recording all the presentations was exhausting; more on this below.<br><br>Anyway, it has been an excellent experience. Meeting other pkgsrc developers in person has been very nice, plus they are all also very nice people too. Of course, their presentations were also interesting, and they showed extremely interesting ideas from their creators. I'm specially looking forward to seeing the preliminary results of one of the detailed projects (won't tell you which ;-).<br><br>So, what did we do? We started with a pre-pkgsrcCon dinner on Thursday night, which was the first encounter among all developers. The talks started the day afterwards in the afternoon, and when they were over we had some beers and dinner together. Saturday was more of the same, even though it had more talks. We then had dinner on a nicer restaurant; great, great time. The last talks happened on Sunday, after which we had some more beers and the last dinner all together.<br><br>I now have to compress all the video recordings and we have yet to decide if we will make them public and how. Stay tuned! (And don't hesitate to join for pkgsrcCon 2008; I'm sure you will enjoy it, at the very least as much as I did!)</p><p class=text-muted>April 29, 2007

Everything went fine except for the configuration of the XFree86 shipped with the base system: I was unable to get high resolutions to work (over 1024x768 if I recall correctly), and I wanted to configure a full-screen desktop. In my specific case, this is 1440x900, the MacBook Pro's native resolution.<br><br>It turns out I had to manually add a mode line to the XF86Config file to get that resolution detected. I bet recent X.Org versions do not need this as, e.g. Fedora Core 6 works fine without manual fiddling.<br><br>Writing mode lines is not fun, but fortunately I came across an automated generator. In fact, this seems to be just a web-based <a href=http://www.sh.nu/nvidia/gtf.php>frontend to the gtf tool</a> provided by NVIDIA. So I entered the appropriate details (x = 1440, y = 900, refresh = 60), hit the <i>Generate modeline</i> button and got:<br><br><tt># 1440x900 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 55.92 kHz; pclk: 106.47 MHz<br><br>Modeline "1440x900_60.00" 106.47 1440 1520 1672 1904 900 901 904 932 -HSync +Vsync</tt><br><br>After that I had to make the <tt>HorizSync</tt> and <tt>VertRefresh</tt> values in my configuration file a bit wider to fulfill this mode's request and everything worked fine. Be extremely careful if you mess with synchronization values though; incorrect ones can physically damage a monitor, although I <i>think</i> this is not a problem for LCDs.</p><p class=text-muted>March 15, 2007

My first idea was to make a contribution to NetBSD by developing an <a href=http://www.NetBSD.org/~jmmv/testing.pdf>automated testing framework</a>. I have had interest in this for a long while (I even proposed it as part of this year's SoC), and there is a lot of interest in it within the project too.<br><br>However, this specific project does not fit correctly into the current research groups at my faculty. This wouldn't be a problem if I wasn't thinking in taking a CS Master or Ph.D. later on. But as I'm seriously considering this possibility, it'd be better if I worked on a project that lets me integrate into an existing research group as early as possible. This could also teach me several new stuff that I'd not learn otherwise: if you look at the paper linked above, you can see I already have several ideas for the testing framework. That is, I already know how I'd address most of it, hence there'd not be a lot of "research". Furthermore, the teacher I talked to about this project felt the core of the project could not be long enough to cover a full semester.<br><br>So what are the other possible ideas? I went to talk to a teacher that currently directs some of the research groups and he proposed me several ideas, organized in three areas:<ul><li>Code analysis and optimization: Here I'd work on tools to analyze existing code and binaries to understand how they work internally; this way one could later generate a better binary by reorganizing related code and/or removing dead bits. They already have done a lot of work on this subject, so I'd be working on a tiny part of it. No matter what, dealing with the compiler/linker and the resulting binaries sounds quite well.</li><br><li>Improve heterogeneous multiprocessor support: This group contains ideas to improve the management of heterogeneous systems such as those based on the Cell processor. I'm "afraid" any project here would be completely Linux-based, but the background idea also feels interesting. Haven't got too much details yet, though.</li><br><li>Distributed systems: This doesn't interest me as much as the other two, but this may be because there was not enough time during the meeting to learn about this group. However, next week we are taking a guided visit to the <a href=http://www.bsc.es/>BSC</a> which will hopefully clear some of my doubts and let me decide if I'm really interested in this area.</li></ul>I shall make a decision as soon as possible, but this is hard!<br><br>Oh, and don't worry about the testing framework project. I'll try to work on this in my spare time because I feel it's something NetBSD really needs and I'm sure I'll enjoy coding it. Not to mention that nowadays, whenever I try to apply any fix to the tree, I feel I should be adding some regression test for it! Plus... I already have a tiny, tiny bit of code :-)</p><p class=text-muted>December 15, 2006

After the program was over, the code was <a href=http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2005/09/tmpfs-project-merged-into-netbsd.html>committed to the repository</a> and some other developers (specially YAMAMOTO Takashi) did several fixes and improvements in it. However, several problems remained in it that prevented tagging it release quality (see <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2006/10/22/0005.html>this thread</a>).<br><br>Finally I found some time to deal with most of them, something that has kept me busy for around three weeks (and which I should have done much, much earlier). All the issues that were resolved are detailed in <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2006/11/09/0005.html>this other post</a>.<br><br>There still are some problems in the code (which code doesn't have any?) but these do not prevent tmpfs from working fine. Of course they should be addressed in the future but people is already enjoying tmpfs in their installations and have been requesting its activation by default for a long time.<br><br>Hence, after core@'s blessing, I'm proud to announce that tmpfs has been <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2006/11/11/0008.html>marked non-experimental</a> and is now enabled by default in the GENERIC kernels of amd64, i386, macppc and sparc64. Other platforms will probably follow soon.<br><br>The next logical step is to replace mfs with tmpfs wherever the former is used (e.g. in sysinst) but more testing is required before this happens. And this is what 4.0_BETA will allow users to do :-) Enjoy!<br><a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2006/11/11/0008.html></a></p><p class=text-muted>November 11, 2006

It provides a disk-like interface to files which allows you to treat them as if they were disks. This is useful, for example, when a file holds a file system image (e.g. the typical ISO-9660 files) and you want to inspect its contents.<br><br>Up until now vnd(4) used the vnode's <tt>bmap</tt> and <tt>strategy</tt> operations to access the backing file. These operate at the block-level and therefore do not involve any system-wide caches; this is why they were used (see below). Unfortunately, some file systems (e.g. tmpfs and smbfs) do not implement these operations so vnd could not work with files stored inside them.<br><br>One of the possible fixes to resolve this problem was to make vnd(4) use the regular <tt>read</tt> and <tt>write</tt> operations; these act on a higher (byte) level and are so fundamental that must be implemented by all file systems. The disadvantage is that all data that flows through these two methods ends up in the buffer cache. (If I understand it correctly, this is problematic because vnd itself will also push a copy of the same data into the cache thus ending up with duplicates in there.)<br><br>Despite that minor problem, I believe it is better to have vnd(4) working in all cases even if that involves some performance penalty in some situations (which can be fixed anyway by implementing the missing operations later on). So this is what I have done: vnd(4) will now use read and write for those files stored in file systems where <tt>bmap</tt> and <tt>strategy</tt> are not available and continue to use the latter two if they are present (as it has always done).<br><br>Some more information can be found in the <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/source-changes/2006/11/09/0032.html>CVS commit</a> and its corresponding <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/query-pr-single.pl?number=34882">bug report</a>.</p><p class=text-muted>November 9, 2006

I liked you at that time. Despite your 1.5 release had slow disk
performance when compared to the other BSDs, I found in you an operating
system that just felt right. You focused on clean and well designed code
among many other goals; sincerely, I didn&rsquo;t come to you looking for
portability because I never had anything else than i386 machines. All
these feelings turned into love after installing and experimenting with
you: the system was minimal, well documented and made sense. As you
know, I soon left FreeBSD and migrated my machines to you.</p></p><p class=text-muted>September 23, 2006

We are quite happy with the current results because the packages are updated very frequently and everything works. Well, <i>almost</i>. There are still several missing details that really hurt the end user experience and need fixing.<br><br>If things continue as have gone until now, we will always be one step (or more!) behind other operating systems such as Linux and FreeBSD. Linux, of course, gets full support from the GNOME developers because they do their daily work on it. FreeBSD, on the other hand, has more people working on the port and therefore have more manpower to resolve all the portability problems; they are doing a nice work.<br><br>In our case, it is clear that we do not have enough manpower to keep up with the huge task that porting GNOME is &mdash; we are <i>very few</i> people working on it. Just consider that GNOME is composed of around 100 packages and that there are new major releases every 6 months (minor ones coming much faster). This updating task imposes a lot of stress on us that prevents us from working on the remaining pending items.<br><br>If we were able to work on all these issues, we could have a fully-functional GNOME Desktop on top of NetBSD. I belive this is a key area to improve NetBSD's visibility: if we had a complete desktop evnrionment, more users could come and use NetBSD for their daily tasks. Eventually, this could attract more developers who would start contributing to the system itself.<br><br>So... I've prepared a <a href=http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/projects.html#gnome>list of GNOME-related projects</a> that details the major items that need to be addressed to have a complete GNOME Desktop installation on top of NetBSD and pkgsrc. I've tried to detail each project as much as possible, explaining the current problem, why solving it could benefit NetBSD and how to get started.<br><br>Should you need more information, I've also written some generic <a href=http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/pkgsrc/gnome.html>guidelines</a> about GNOME packaging and porting. And, of course, you can <a href="mailto:jmmv AT NetBSD DOT org">contact me</a> to get more details and take one of the projects! I'm willing to mentor you to make them success. You can certainly make a difference to the current status of things.<br><br>Let me add that I've have <i>learned a lot</i> about many different areas from my contributions to pkgsrc and NetBSD. You can seize the opportunity to learn new exciting stuff too; don't be shy! Oh... and if GNOME on NetBSD is not of your preference, please see our <a href=http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/projects.html>complete list of proposed projects</a>; I bet you will find something of your interest!</p><p class=text-muted>September 1, 2006

I curse that day! ;-) I've been investigating that problem since then and (very) beleatedly fixing some issues in other GNOME programs during the process.<br><br>D-Bus' session daemon did not work under NetBSD because it couldn't authenticate incoming connections; that was due to the lack of socket credentials.

We saw <a href=http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2006/08/localcreds-socket-credentials.html>yesterday</a> multiple details about <tt>LOCAL_CREDS</tt> socket credentials and, as you may deduce, I missed some.<br><br>First of all I assumed that setting the <tt>LOCAL_CREDS</tt> option only affected the next received message (I didn't mention this explicitly in the post though). It turns out that this is incorrect: enabling this option makes the socket transmit credentials information on each message until the option is disabled again.<br><br>Secondly, setting the <tt>LOCAL_CREDS</tt> option on a server socket (one configured with the <tt>listen(2)</tt> call) results in all sockets created from it through <tt>accept(2)</tt> to also carry the flag enabled. In other words, it is inherited.<br><br>These features are interesting because, when using combined, avoid the need for the synchronization protocol outlined in the previous post — in some cases only. If the credentials are to be transmitted at the very beginning of the connection, the server can follow these steps:<br><ol><li>Create the server socket and configure it with <tt>bind(2)</tt> and <tt>listen(2)</tt>.</li><li>Before entering the <tt>accept(2)</tt> loop, set the <tt>LOCAL_CREDS</tt> option on the server socket.</li><li>Enter the <tt>accept(2)</tt> loop and start accepting clients.</li><li>For each new client:</li><ol><li>Receive its first message.</li><li>Get the credentials from it.</li><li>Disable the <tt>LOCAL_CREDS</tt> option from the socket used to communicate with that specific client.</li></ol></ol>It couldn't be easier! This is still different to all other socket credentials methods I know of but can be easily adapted to protocols that were not designed to support <tt>LOCAL_CREDS</tt> (i.e. that do not implement the synchronization explained in the previous post).</p><p class=text-muted>August 28, 2006

The operating system is in charge of managing this information, sent separately from the data flow, so that the user processes cannot fake it. There are many different implementations of this concept out there as you can imagine.<br><br>For some reason I assumed for a long time that NetBSD didn't support any kind of socket credentials. However, I recently discovered that it indeed supports them through the <tt>LOCAL_CREDS</tt> socket option. Unfortunately it behaves quite differently from other methods. This poses some annoying portability problems in applications not designed in the first place to support it (e.g. <a href=http://dbus.freedesktop.org/>D-Bus</a>, the specific program I'm fighting right now).<br><br><tt>LOCAL_CREDS</tt> works as follows:<br><ol><li>The receiver interested in remote credentials uses <tt>setsockopt(2)</tt> to enable the <tt>LOCAL_CREDS</tt> option in the socket.</li><li>The sender sends a message through the channel either with <tt>write(2)</tt> or <tt>sendmsg(2)</tt>. It needn't do anything special other than ensuring that the message is sent <b>after</b> the receiver has enabled the <tt>LOCAL_CREDS</tt> option.</li><li>The receiver gets the message using <tt>recvmsg(2)</tt> and parses the out of band data stored in the control buffer: a <tt>struct sockcred</tt> message that contains the remote credentials (UID, GID, etc.). This does not provide the PID of the remote process though, as other implementations do.</li></ol>The tricky part here is to ensure that the sender writes the message after the receiver has enabled the <tt>LOCAL_CREDS</tt> option. If this is not guaranteed, a race condition appears and the behavior becomes random: some times the receiver will get socket credentials, some times it will not.<br><br>To ensure this restriction there needs to be some kind of synchronization protocol between the two peers. This is illustrated in the following example: it assumes a client/server model and a "go on" message used to synchronize. The server could do:<br><ol><li>Wait for client connection.</li><li>Set <tt>LOCAL_CREDS</tt> option on remote socket.</li><li>Send a "go on" message to client.<br></li><li>Wait for a response, which carries the credentials.</li><li>Parse the credentials.<br></li></ol>And the client could do:<br><ol><li>Connect to server.</li><li>Wait until "go on" message.</li><li>Send any message to the server.</li></ol>To conclude, a sample example program that shows how to manage the <tt>LOCAL_CREDS</tt> option. <tt>socketpair(2)</tt> is used for simplicity, but this can easily be extrapolated to two independent programs.<br><br><pre>#include &lt;sys/param.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;sys/inttypes.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;sys/un.h&gt;<br><br>#include &lt;err.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;string.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;<br><br>int<br>main(void)<br>{<br>    int sv[2];<br>    int on = 1;<br>    ssize_t len;<br>    struct iovec iov;<br>    struct msghdr msg;<br>    struct {<br>        struct cmsghdr hdr;<br>        struct sockcred cred;<br>        gid_t groups[NGROUPS - 1];<br>    } cmsg;<br><br>    /*<br>     * Create a pair of interconnected sockets for simplicity:<br>     * sv[0] - Receive end (this program).<br>     * sv[1] - Write end (the remote program, theorically).<br>     */<br>    if (socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, sv) == -1)<br>        err(EXIT_FAILURE, "socketpair");<br><br>    /*<br>     * Enable the LOCAL_CREDS option on the reception socket.<br>     */<br>    if (setsockopt(sv[0], 0, LOCAL_CREDS, &on, sizeof(on)) == -1)<br>        err(EXIT_FAILURE, "setsockopt");<br><br>    /*<br>     * The remote application writes the message AFTER setsockopt<br>     * has been used by the receiver.
