Time flies :-(
Today I got up late after yesterday's hang out and then went to have lunch with my new roommate and his brother. After lunch, my roommate had to got back to work, and his brother and I walked downtown to take a look at the World Trade Center. After seeing that, we walked by the southern coast and saw the Statue of Liberty in the distance.</description></item><item><title>TV series: Jericho</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/09/tv-series-jericho.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2007 17:49:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/09/tv-series-jericho.html</guid><description>Just finished watching Jericho's first season, aired during the summer on the Spanish Tele 5 channel. What an incredible drama show! It has all ingredients to keep you hooked: well balanced characters, good acting and scenery, lots of action and, of course, a good dose of suspense (OK, not as much as in Lost, but that's exaggerate). It is a pity it was cancelled and, after looking at their site, I don't really understand if there will be a second season or not; I hope there'll be.</description></item></channel></rss>
