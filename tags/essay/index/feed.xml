Yet they are routinely proposed as the solution to all problems. Is there anything you can do to minimize the risk? In this post, I propose that you actively improve the old system to ensure the new system cannot make progress in a haphazard way. This forces the new system to be designed in such a way that delivers breakthrough improvements and not just incremental improvements.</description></item><item><title>On smartphones and email procrastination</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2019/01/smartphones-email-procrastination.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2019 06:30:00 -0500</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2019/01/smartphones-email-procrastination.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I used to be good at replying to emails on time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When tens of emails came in every day, I would sort them out and I would reply right away to anything that needed or caught my attention. The so-called Inbox Zero wasn&amp;rsquo;t a specific goal that required effort: &amp;ldquo;it just was&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things have changed over the years and I am now quite awful at dealing with personal email. Some emails can go weeks (or, I confess, months) before getting a reply. Paradoxically, the more important an email is, the longer it can take me to reply.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Compilers in the (BSD) base system</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2015/10/compilers-in-the-bsd-base-system.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2015 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2015/10/compilers-in-the-bsd-base-system.html</guid><description>&lt;p>A commonly held axiom in the BSD community is that the C compiler belongs in the base system. &amp;ldquo;This is how things have been since the beginning of time and they define the way BSD systems are&amp;rdquo;, the proposition goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But why is that? What makes &amp;ldquo;having a compiler in base&amp;rdquo; a BSD system? Why is the compiler a necessary part of the base system? Hold on, is it? Could we take it out?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An open letter to online support staff</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/open-letter-to-online-support.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2015 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/open-letter-to-online-support.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Dear online support staff member,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am probably not your average customer. If I send a support request to your team by email, it is because I have already exhausted all possible resources on my side and concluded, with good certainty, that there is an issue on your service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, I have read your online support material. I have tried different browsers. I have tried different devices and operating systems. I have tried disabling browser extensions. I have tried clearing cookies. I have looked at the Javascript console for errors&amp;mdash;which, by the way, your application is probably throwing even during normal operation; shrug. I have danced three times around the computer and clapped my hands.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"Your English is pretty good!", they said</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/your-english-is-pretty-good-they-said.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/your-english-is-pretty-good-they-said.html</guid><description>&lt;p>As I spend September in Seoul and attend an intensive Korean language course, &lt;strong>my story with English&lt;/strong> comes to mind. This is a story I have told a bunch of times to friends and coworkers and it&amp;rsquo;s time to write it down for posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the title of this post is a verbatim quote of something I have been told many times throughout the years:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if you could witness how an experienced developer manages the tools of the craft so that you could draw ideas and incorporate them into your own workflow?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>This post aims to answer the above for the type of work I do by sharing how my workflow looks like. I want to compel you to share your own story in the comments section, and by doing so, create a collection of stories so that others can benefit from them.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2015-09-08-header.png" length="1242379" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>How to commit a code hack and not perish along the way</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2015/06/how-to-commit-a-code-hack.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2015 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2015/06/how-to-commit-a-code-hack.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>You are the developer in charge to resolve a problem and have prepared a &lt;em>&lt;a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.advanced.changelists.html">changelist&lt;/a>&lt;/em> to fix the bug. You need the changelist to be reviewed by someone else before checkin. Your changelist &lt;em>is&lt;/em> an ugly hack.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What kind of response are you gonna get from your reviewer? Well as with everything: &lt;em>it depends!&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>If you have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>clearly stated upfront that the changelist &lt;em>is&lt;/em> a hack,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>explained &lt;em>how&lt;/em> it is a hack,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>justified&lt;/em> that the hack is the right thing to do at this moment, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>outlined what the &lt;em>real solution&lt;/em> to get rid of the hack would be&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;em>then&lt;/em> your reviewer will most likely just accept the change without fuss (!) and will proceed to review its contents per se. But if you miss &lt;em>any&lt;/em> of those steps, then your reviewer is going to be super-critical about your changelist &lt;em>and&lt;/em> any further related changes you may want to commit.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2015-06-19-header.jpg" length="245551" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Get a handle on email subscriptions</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2015/06/get-a-handle-on-email-subscriptions.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2015 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2015/06/get-a-handle-on-email-subscriptions.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Do you have any idea which online services and stores have you given your email address to?

&lt;p>Three years ago, I was not able to answer these two simple questions when I decided to move my email account to our new family-owned domain. Today?

&lt;p>And after all this time, it finally hit me: personal blogs have lost their original appeal. It is time for a change. But a change to what?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
