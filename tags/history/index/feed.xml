Back then, I did not fully comprehend what I was doing and why the tools I used were impressive given the constraints of the hardware we had. Having gained more knowledge throughout the years, it is now really fun to pick up DOSBox to re-experience those programs and compare them with our current state of affairs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, I want to look at the pure text-based IDEs that we had in that era before Windows eclipsed the PC industry. I want to do this because those IDEs had little to envy from the IDEs of today&amp;mdash;yet it feels as if we went through a dark era where we lost most of those features for years and they are only resurfacing now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If anything, stay for a nostalgic ride back in time and a little rant on &amp;ldquo;bloat&amp;rdquo;. But, more importantly, read on to gain perspective on what existed before so that you can evaluate future feature launches more critically.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hard disk LEDs and noisy machines</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/hard-disk-leds-and-noisy-machines.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 09:20:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/hard-disk-leds-and-noisy-machines.html</guid><description>&lt;p>The computers of yesteryear had this little feature known as blinking LED lights 🔆. They also had this other feature called noisy disks 💾 and loud fans 🪭. Uh wait. Features? Why &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;annoyances&amp;rdquo;?! 🧵👇&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You see, these bright lights and loud noises acted as canaries 🐦 in a performance mine. They gave developers a chance to notice when things were off performance-wise. If your code abused the CPU or the hard disk by mistake, you could tell right away.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A CLI text editor? In my Windows?</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/a-cli-text-editor-in-my-windows.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 14:45:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/a-cli-text-editor-in-my-windows.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>It&amp;rsquo;s more likely than you think!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a surprising twist of events, Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/plante_msft/status/1732857615997132834">exploring the addition of a command-line (CLI) text editor to Windows&lt;/a>. If you ask me, &lt;em>not&lt;/em> having a CLI text editor on Windows is mind-boggling: you can access a Windows machine via SSH these days, so not having an editor that works in the console is a big handicap for remote system administration. So, should Windows bundle a CLI text editor? Of course it should.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
