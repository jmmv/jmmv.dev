Dirt and the City is a blog that intends to show you the "ugly" (literally) side of NYC. The blog is named after a famous TV show filmed in this same city; I haven't watched the show myself, but I bet that there is no dirt to be seen in it.</p><p class=text-muted>September 4, 2011

Two days ago I landed in Barcelona and my stay in NYC finished. I was happy to see family and friends again, but I'm missing NYC and, in special, the people there a lot.
I'm actually considering moving to NYC as soon as I find a decent job there and postponing the acquisition of a Ph.D. Many people says I should just do that, but some friends say that my feelings will eventually go away and I'll feel comfortable here again.</p><p class=text-muted>December 17, 2008

Quick summary: the internship has been great, working at Google is amazing and my project was more or less finished.
I'll provide more details about the whole experience later when I'm back to my country, but now is vacations time.</p><p class=text-muted>November 22, 2008

No sleep at all except for a little bit of pseudo-sleep in the plane. The Google campus is really nice. It puts the NYC offices in an inferior level than I thought :P But the only problem is that the area surrounding the campus is basically empty.</p><p class=text-muted>October 24, 2008

But so far, things are going great. They could certainly be a little bit better, but not by much!
Today, two friends from Spain just left my apartment.</p><p class=text-muted>September 13, 2008

I also apologize (to those who have noted!) for not writing for the past week, but I have lost "interest". All posts were starting to be similar to each other because there aren't that many new things to explain every day. Or, put it another way: I now usually have better things to do in the evenings rather than blogging :-P</p><p class=text-muted>August 20, 2008

Day 22 (August 9th): Stayed at home for most of the day, which was pretty nice because I had not done this since I left Barcelona four weeks ago.</p><p class=text-muted>August 11, 2008

This includes a water bottle, a towel, yet another t-shirt and a notebook.
Somewhat related: I also ate way too much, which makes my stomach hurt and feel incredibly tired.</p><p class=text-muted>August 7, 2008

Day 17: Some more learning work at Google. The interesting thing of that day was that a friend from Barcelona arrived to the city at 10pm approximately, so we went to have a beer to a place in the lower East River.</p><p class=text-muted>August 7, 2008

Today I got up late after yesterday's hang out and then went to have lunch with my new roommate and his brother. After lunch, my roommate had to got back to work, and his brother and I walked downtown to take a look at the World Trade Center. After seeing that, we walked by the southern coast and saw the Statue of Liberty in the distance.</p><p class=text-muted>August 3, 2008

Day 14: Moved to the new apartment. It was pretty annoying to have to move all my stuff using the subway, basically due to the incredible heat in the streets and inside the subway. But finally, I have a relatively decent place to stay for the four months. Shared with another person, cheaper than the older apartment and.</p><p class=text-muted>August 2, 2008

The location is good because it is just one block away from Google and is also very close to lots and lots of pubs and restaurants.
Haven't done much work today though. I spent all the morning applying for a SSN number, and then I spent part of the evening opening a bank account and getting used to its online services.</p><p class=text-muted>July 30, 2008

Let's hope I can open the account tomorrow... but even then, the transfer of the money I have in Spain to this account will not happen on the same day, so I'm not sure about how I'll deal with the housing payment.</p><p class=text-muted>July 29, 2008

After breakfast (which was pretty late today because I woke up late), I headed to the Apple Store in 5th Avenue. Instead of taking the subway, I walked all the way down through Central Park which accounts for 40 streets and a couple of avenues. Doing so was pretty nice, as the views in Central Park are amazing — and which is the reason why my camera had 93 photos when I got home.</p><p class=text-muted>July 27, 2008

Yes, that's the best word to describe today. I woke up early due to an unexpected phone call and went to have breakfast to some random place close to my current house. Then, and for the first time ever, I went to do the laundry. What a waste of time. Sure, I'd have returned home while the washing machine and the dryer were working but, taking 30 minutes each, it's difficult to do anything productive in these separate periods of time.</p><p class=text-muted>July 26, 2008

So what did I do yesterday? It was a pretty regular day, with probably two things worth to note. First, I have not been able to find housing yet, so I asked my current tenant if I could stay one more week in the place where I am now; fortunately, it worked, so now I have one more week to look for something else.</p><p class=text-muted>July 25, 2008

Getting into Manhattan was quite a mess though. Instead of picking a taxi, I decided to try to make my way through the subway system.</p><p class=text-muted>July 20, 2008
