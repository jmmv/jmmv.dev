The blog is named after a famous TV show filmed in this same city; I haven't watched the show myself, but I bet that there is no dirt to be seen in it. If you are wondering what the city really looks like, this blog is your place.&lt;br />&lt;br />But, before visiting the blog, be sure to take it as it is meant to be: just a fun collection of photos! If you ever want to visit NYC, don't let the contents of the blog change your plans. You will definitely enjoy your visit regardless.&lt;br />&lt;br />Without further ado, and just in case you missed the link above, &lt;a href="http://dirtandthecity.blogspot.com/">click here to visit Dirt and the City&lt;/a>.</description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: Not any more</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/12/livenyc-not-any-more.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2008 16:47:00 -0500</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/12/livenyc-not-any-more.html</guid><description>That's it. Two days ago I landed in Barcelona and my stay in NYC finished. I was happy to see family and friends again, but I'm missing NYC and, in special, the people there a lot.&lt;br />&lt;br />I'm actually considering moving to NYC as soon as I find a decent job there and postponing the acquisition of a Ph.D. Many people says I should just do that, but some friends say that my feelings will eventually go away and I'll feel comfortable here again. I know that this second thing is true, but why should I accept that if there is a chance for a change? Why can't I try to go and live there? Why do I have to hurt the people I met there? I can think of some reasons to stay in Barcelona for, but I can also think of more interesting reasons to leave.&lt;br />&lt;br />Anyway... don't worry, this is not the common post you'll find in this blog! I think I'll just go back to blogging about technical stuff. I know I still have to prepare a summary post for the stay and probably a relatively small selection of photos, but I think that will come later. If you ever can go to NYC, don't doubt: just do it.</description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: Coming to an end</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/11/livenyc-coming-to-end.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2008 12:06:00 -0500</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/11/livenyc-coming-to-end.html</guid><description>That's it. My internship at Google finished this past Thursday (that is one day and a half ago) and I'm going back to Spain on December 2nd. A week and a half to go and my time at NYC is over. Quick summary: the internship has been great, working at Google is amazing and my project was more or less finished.&lt;br />&lt;br />I'll provide more details about the whole experience later when I'm back to my country, but now is vacations time. I really need to relax a bit; haven't had vacations for more than a year and a half! And, when I get back, I'll have to start working on my Ph.D. immediately.&lt;br />&lt;br />So what am I going to do? I'm leaving to San Francisco tomorrow morning and I'll spend four days there by myself, exploring that other nice city. I'll be back to NYC for thanksgiving and then use the rest of the days to visit a couple of museums, buy presents and, if time permits, visit Washington DC.&lt;br />&lt;br />Next post will probably be from San Francisco ;) C ya.</description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: ... or not; now in MTV!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/10/livenyc-or-not-now-in-mtv.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2008 19:08:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/10/livenyc-or-not-now-in-mtv.html</guid><description>I've landed this morning in San Francisco at 9.00am (which means I left NYC at 6.00am!) and went straight down to the Google Headquarters in Mountain View. No sleep at all except for a little bit of pseudo-sleep in the plane. The Google campus is really nice. It puts the NYC offices in an inferior level than I thought :P But the only problem is that the area surrounding the campus is basically empty. Very small houses and lots of space between them, which is not bad per se... but means that there really is not much to do.&lt;br />&lt;br />Anyway. What am I doing here? I am attending the Google Summer of Code 2008 Mentors Summit this weekend, but came a bit earlier to be able to do a couple of meetings with coworkers in the Mountain View office. Pretty exhausting day, and it is not close to over yet!&lt;br />&lt;br />Just enjoy the &lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/jmmv84/VisitToGoogleHQMTV#">few photos I've taken so far&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />PS: Been playing mini-golf on-board until I got an unasked segmentation fault.</description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: Prospect Park</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/10/livenyc-prospect-park.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2008 22:22:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/10/livenyc-prospect-park.html</guid><description>Yesterday night, we went to a techno club &amp;mdash; Webster Hall &amp;mdash; which had Carl Cox as an invited DJ. Some of my friends around here enjoy this music and said this was a great DJ, so we couldn't miss it. He indeed was good.&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Today, after few hours of sleep, I have been doing quite a bit of housework: basically, huge cleaning, reordering and some DIY &amp;mdash; had to fix some drawers. Resolving the extremely loud and annoying hissing caused by the heating system will have to wait, though.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>What I have enjoyed today, though, is spending the evening walking around Brooklyn and, more specifically, in &lt;a href="http://www.prospectpark.org/">Prospect Park&lt;/a>. Central Park is very nice, you know, but this other park is too! Not to mention that the borough (Brooklyn) seems awesome... or at least the few neighborhoods I've visited so far. Much more relaxed than Manhattan and, I've been told, cheaper for living. Anyway, enjoy &lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/jmmv84/ProspectPark#">the photos&lt;/a> :-)&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>I guess tomorrow will be, finally, a museum day. Not going out tonight (I'm extremely tired and can't meet my friends) so I guess I'll be able to wake up early and seize the day. We'll see.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Note to self: never, never, &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">never again&lt;/span>, buy batteries from a crappy deli. They last for a few photos only! Who knows for how long they have been in the shop shelves.&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: 2 months and a half</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/10/livenyc-2-months-and-half.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2008 20:50:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/10/livenyc-2-months-and-half.html</guid><description>Wow, I haven't blogged for a long time (a month since last post) and I'm already counting down my days in NYC... less than a month and a half left here :-( I certainly miss some things from home, such as the nice little (non-fancy) bars, my bike, the gym, a nice house and, of course, friends and family, but I'm not in a real hurry to go back.&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>So what have been the recent happenings? There are lots of things to tell I guess.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>First of all, almost all interns are gone. Of all I knew, probably 15-20, only 2 are left, 3 if you count me. This probably means we'll have to look for new friends to grow our partying group a little bit.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>On another topic, I don't have roommates any more. The ones I had moved to a bigger place and I haven't yet found anyone who wants to share this apartment. The major problem is that the room to be rented is, actually, the living room, so it is hard to convince someone to live here. Lack of privacy is an issue for most even if they don't say so right away.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>As regards working out, I'm getting way too lazy. It has already been more than a week since I last went running. Will try to force myself to go tomorrow morning again; the food is already starting to accumulate in the wrong places. Somewhat related to this, I've got an iPod Nano 4th generation which, when put together the Nike+ kit, is amazing.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>And we have got a "new" addiction at work: Guitar Hero. This game is really nice and we are already playing it on the expert level. However, I wonder if it is any good to spend time learning how to play a fake guitar. I'd rather go and buy a real one, and instead spend my time playing real songs. Let's hope &lt;a href="http://www.guitarrising.com/">Guitar Rising&lt;/a> keeps up with the expectations and is published soon; whenever that happens, I'll definitely get it.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>About more recent happenings, I've been in &lt;a href="http://www.nycbsdcon.org/2008/">NYCBSDCon 2008&lt;/a> this weekend giving a presentation on ATF. We'll have the video recordings posted out soon, so be sure to check them to learn some interesting new stuff. It was also a good way to meet well-known people in the BSD world such as, for example, Matt Dillon and Dru Lavigne.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>As regards work at Google, my project is starting to have decent shape, which means that it actually works! During the next month, I'll have to extend it to some new areas, and that's a bit scary because they'll involve processing vast amounts of data in an efficient manner. (At the moment, the data set is not big enough to really require tuning the code.)&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;div>Oh, and one last thing about mini-golf. I have played, I think, 4 times already and lost in all of them. This game sucks. Will keep trying, though.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>I'm missing lots of stuff here, but I don't know how to add more random notes and not end with a completely disconnected post. All the paragraphs are already too independent as they are now. So just wait for the next one to know more :P&lt;/div>&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: Almost 2 months</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/09/livenyc-almost-2-months.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2008 20:43:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/09/livenyc-almost-2-months.html</guid><description>I just realized that today makes two months since I left my home in Barcelona and headed first to Italy and then to NYC. This means I only have two more months and a week to stay at Google. Ew, time flies so fast...&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>But so far, things are going great. They could certainly be a little bit better, but not by much!&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Today, two friends from Spain just left my apartment. They had been here for 10 days doing tourism around the city and visiting lots of stuff. I wish I could also take some vacations like that.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>And tomorrow it's time for another race: &lt;a href="http://cms.komen.org/komen/NewsEvents/RacefortheCure/index.htm">Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure&lt;/a>. It is just 5Km in Central Park, so it will be pretty easy but, hopefully, fun enough. The only "problem" is that it is at 9am, and today is Saturday... so I need to hang go out (with some restrictions)!&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: Month 1</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/08/livenyc-month-1.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2008 12:12:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/08/livenyc-month-1.html</guid><description>Wow, I realized yesterday that I have already been in NYC for a full month! That means that I only have three left before leaving... time flies :-(&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>I also apologize (to those who have noted!) for not writing for the past week, but I have lost "interest".  All posts were starting to be similar to each other because there aren't that many new things to explain every day.  Or, put it another way: I now usually have better things to do in the evenings rather than blogging :-P&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>As regards work, I have spent the past two weeks trying to code something, but all my attempts were worthless. Yesterday, though, my manager and I found a trivial way to resolve the problem at hand. It is not the nicest solution, but does the trick for now. Ew, two weeks of "wasted" coding efforts! But, as he put it, these efforts have been a good way to introduce myself into big projects within Google.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Now I have been assigned another coding task and it seems pretty darn cool to me. This is not related to my real project, though, but it should be possible to finish it in one week and will be useful to give me more exposure to other Google technologies. In special, MapReduce. Yeah, I can say that; after all, what MapReduce is is disclosed ;-)&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Before finishing, let me point out something else that has caught my attention here in the city. There are lots of places to get your nails done, and all the people in these places is visible from the street. Curious, at the very least.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Oh! Be sure to listen to the "Gettysburg trilogy" (the three songs in the second disc) in The Glorious Burden album from Iced Earth. Have been quite addicted to it for the last days.&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: Days 21, 22 and 23</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/08/livenyc-days-21-22-and-23.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2008 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/08/livenyc-days-21-22-and-23.html</guid><description>Day 21 (August 8th): Some work at Google and went out later with a friend from work and the friends that are visiting from Barcelona. We went to a bar called Spice Market: quite fancy but also expensive and not that fun.&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Day 22 (August 9th): Stayed at home for most of the day, which was pretty nice because I had not done this since I left Barcelona four weeks ago. In the morning, I went to a barber though. At night, went out with my roommate and some of her friends to a party. This was also an excuse to celebrate my birthday, which happened today (in day 23rd, I mean).&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Day 23 (August 10th): Turned 24. Went shopping for a fast external hard disk and ended up buying a Lacie D2 Quadra 500GB. Did some tests using the FW800 connection and the results are quite impressive. I spent part of the evening at Google doing some personal work, then went running and then drank cava at home to "celebrate" my birthday.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>OK, and now that I remember, here is another thing that has caught my attention in NYC. There are a lot of places to cut your nails... and what's "interesting" is that, from the street, you can see all the people sitting there while they are being served.&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: Day 20</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/08/livenyc-day-20.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2008 22:28:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/08/livenyc-day-20.html</guid><description>&lt;div>Another regular day at work, except that I have finally been assigned some coding work. Yay! Haven't coded for a rather long while, and I need to do something. Aside that, got some Google gear that I was supposed to get on the first day but didn't. This includes a water bottle, a towel, yet another t-shirt and a notebook.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Somewhat related: I also ate way too much, which makes my stomach hurt and feel incredibly tired. Or maybe I am tired due to the run this evening, in which I pushed myself too hard. But I must run the Human Race (10Km) in less than 45 minutes! Yes, personal goal.&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: Day 17, 18 and 19</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/08/livenyc-day-17-18-and-19.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2008 10:42:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/08/livenyc-day-17-18-and-19.html</guid><description>I should have posted this yesterday at most... but anyway, here it comes so that I do not forget about recent happenings. What I mean is that day 19th was yesterday (August 6th), not today!&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Day 17: Some more learning work at Google. The interesting thing of that day was that a friend from Barcelona arrived to the city at 10pm approximately, so we went to have a beer to a place in the lower East River. Very touristic but pretty nice. Also, he was riding a hired car, so I was able to see the city from another "perspective".&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Day 18: Again, some more learning. At midday, I registered for the Nike Human Race, a 10Km race that will take place on August 31st in 25 cities around the world. The nice thing is that for the low registration fee, I got a pair of shiny new sneakers and the Nike+ Sportsband. Now I have Nike shoes, the iPod+Nike kit at home (a present from another race)... so I am now only missing a real iPod! At night I went out with a Spanish colleague from work and two other Spanish guys, friends of him, that are also visiting the city.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Day 19: Tried the new sneakers and the Sportsband. Both are pretty amazing! Comfortable shoes and the measures taken by the sensors seem to be quite accurate. Plus you can get a nice history of your runs on the website. At work, I finally did some coding. And, in the evening, we had a Google Boat Cruise for interns (&lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/jmmv84/GoogleBoatCruise">photos available&lt;/a>) followed by beers at a couple of bars.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Bah, I should get back to posting once per day to avoid such telegraphic descriptions...&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: Day 16</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/08/livenyc-day-16.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2008 22:03:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/08/livenyc-day-16.html</guid><description>Wow... two weeks have passed already. Time flies :-(&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Today I got up late after yesterday's hang out and then went to have lunch with my new roommate and his brother. After lunch, my roommate had to got back to work, and his brother and I walked downtown to take a look at the World Trade Center. After seeing that, we walked by the southern coast and saw the Statue of Liberty in the distance. I guess I'll have to take the ferry one day and see it from a closer distance, but better wait until there are not too many tourists and for colder weather. At last, we returned to visit Google going all along Broadway, while visiting some shops.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>I'm really exhausted. Google Earth says that we walked for almost 11Km non-stop! Check out &lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/jmmv84/TripToTheWTC">the photos&lt;/a>!&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Edit (22:50)&lt;/span>: Just finished watching Season 1 of The Big Bang Theory. Hilarious! I'm eager to see more episodes, but that'll have to wait until Season 2 is aired.&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: Days 13, 14 and 15</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/08/livenyc-days-13-14-and-15.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Aug 2008 21:53:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/08/livenyc-days-13-14-and-15.html</guid><description>Day 13: Not much to comment, other than I finally got my welcome Google t-shirt!&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Day 14: Moved to the new apartment. It was pretty annoying to have to move all my stuff using the subway, basically due to the incredible heat in the streets and inside the subway. But finally, I have a relatively decent place to stay for the four months. Shared with another person, cheaper than the older apartment and... just one block away from Google! Oh, and at night I went to one of these ultra-classy clubs (230 Fifth Avenue) with several other interns and later to a couple of bars. &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Wasted&lt;/span> way too much money.&lt;/div>&lt;div>&lt;br />&lt;/div>&lt;div>Day 15: Properly installed in the apartment by emptying the bags and filling the closet and drawers. Finally! I had had all my stuff in the bag for three weeks already and it was pretty annoying to find stuff this way. Also walked around the neighborhood and checked several book shops. I saw many interesting books that I would like to buy one day (in special, one about Haskell!), but just before leaving the last shop I was visiting (Barnes &amp;amp; Noble), I passed by a set of books that were discounted 50% of the price. And one of them immediately caught my eye: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Manual-Writers-Research-Dissertations-Seventh/dp/0226823377">A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, Seventh Edition: Chicago Style for Students and Researchers&lt;/a>. At the ridiculous price it was selling, I couldn't resist buying it! Let's hope it is useful :) Now... maybe it's time to go out again, but this time with my new roommate and his brother.&lt;/div></description></item><item><title>Live@NYC: Day 12</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/07/livenyc-day-12.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2008 23:11:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/07/livenyc-day-12.html</guid><description>At last, my new apartment is...
