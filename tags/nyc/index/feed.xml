      <title>Introducing &#39;Dirt and the City&#39;</title>

      <description>A friend of mine recently started a blog called Dirt and the City and, because he has invited me to contribute to it, I feel like posting a reference here ;-)
Dirt and the City is a blog that intends to show you the &#34;ugly&#34; (literally) side of NYC. The blog is named after a famous TV show filmed in this same city; I haven&#39;t watched the show myself, but I bet that there is no dirt to be seen in it.</description>

      <title>Live@NYC: Not any more</title>

      <description>That&#39;s it. Two days ago I landed in Barcelona and my stay in NYC finished. I was happy to see family and friends again, but I&#39;m missing NYC and, in special, the people there a lot.
I&#39;m actually considering moving to NYC as soon as I find a decent job there and postponing the acquisition of a Ph.D. Many people says I should just do that, but some friends say that my feelings will eventually go away and I&#39;ll feel comfortable here again.</description>

      <title>Live@NYC: Coming to an end</title>

      <description>That&#39;s it. My internship at Google finished this past Thursday (that is one day and a half ago) and I&#39;m going back to Spain on December 2nd. A week and a half to go and my time at NYC is over. Quick summary: the internship has been great, working at Google is amazing and my project was more or less finished.
I&#39;ll provide more details about the whole experience later when I&#39;m back to my country, but now is vacations time.</description>

      <title>Live@NYC: ... or not; now in MTV!</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve landed this morning in San Francisco at 9.00am (which means I left NYC at 6.00am!) and went straight down to the Google Headquarters in Mountain View. No sleep at all except for a little bit of pseudo-sleep in the plane. The Google campus is really nice. It puts the NYC offices in an inferior level than I thought :P But the only problem is that the area surrounding the campus is basically empty.</description>

      <description>Yesterday night, we went to a techno club &amp;mdash; Webster Hall &amp;mdash; which had Carl Cox as an invited DJ. Some of my friends around here enjoy this music and said this was a great DJ, so we couldn&#39;t miss it. He indeed was good.
Today, after few hours of sleep, I have been doing quite a bit of housework: basically, huge cleaning, reordering and some DIY &amp;mdash; had to fix some drawers.</description>

      <title>Live@NYC: 2 months and a half</title>

      <description>Wow, I haven&#39;t blogged for a long time (a month since last post) and I&#39;m already counting down my days in NYC... less than a month and a half left here :-( I certainly miss some things from home, such as the nice little (non-fancy) bars, my bike, the gym, a nice house and, of course, friends and family, but I&#39;m not in a real hurry to go back.
So what have been the recent happenings?</description>

      <title>Live@NYC: Almost 2 months</title>

      <description>I just realized that today makes two months since I left my home in Barcelona and headed first to Italy and then to NYC. This means I only have two more months and a week to stay at Google. Ew, time flies so fast...
But so far, things are going great. They could certainly be a little bit better, but not by much!
Today, two friends from Spain just left my apartment.</description>

      <description>Wow, I realized yesterday that I have already been in NYC for a full month! That means that I only have three left before leaving... time flies :-(
I also apologize (to those who have noted!) for not writing for the past week, but I have lost &#34;interest&#34;. All posts were starting to be similar to each other because there aren&#39;t that many new things to explain every day. Or, put it another way: I now usually have better things to do in the evenings rather than blogging :-P</description>

      <description>Day 21 (August 8th): Some work at Google and went out later with a friend from work and the friends that are visiting from Barcelona. We went to a bar called Spice Market: quite fancy but also expensive and not that fun.
Day 22 (August 9th): Stayed at home for most of the day, which was pretty nice because I had not done this since I left Barcelona four weeks ago.</description>

      <description>Another regular day at work, except that I have finally been assigned some coding work. Yay! Haven&#39;t coded for a rather long while, and I need to do something. Aside that, got some Google gear that I was supposed to get on the first day but didn&#39;t. This includes a water bottle, a towel, yet another t-shirt and a notebook.
Somewhat related: I also ate way too much, which makes my stomach hurt and feel incredibly tired.</description>

      <description>I should have posted this yesterday at most... but anyway, here it comes so that I do not forget about recent happenings. What I mean is that day 19th was yesterday (August 6th), not today!
Day 17: Some more learning work at Google. The interesting thing of that day was that a friend from Barcelona arrived to the city at 10pm approximately, so we went to have a beer to a place in the lower East River.</description>

      <description>Wow... two weeks have passed already. Time flies :-(
Today I got up late after yesterday&#39;s hang out and then went to have lunch with my new roommate and his brother. After lunch, my roommate had to got back to work, and his brother and I walked downtown to take a look at the World Trade Center. After seeing that, we walked by the southern coast and saw the Statue of Liberty in the distance.</description>

      <description>Day 13: Not much to comment, other than I finally got my welcome Google t-shirt!
Day 14: Moved to the new apartment. It was pretty annoying to have to move all my stuff using the subway, basically due to the incredible heat in the streets and inside the subway. But finally, I have a relatively decent place to stay for the four months. Shared with another person, cheaper than the older apartment and.</description>

      <description>At last, my new apartment is... OMG confirmed! Will be moving on August 1st and will stay there for four months. The location is good because it is just one block away from Google and is also very close to lots and lots of pubs and restaurants.
Haven&#39;t done much work today though. I spent all the morning applying for a SSN number, and then I spent part of the evening opening a bank account and getting used to its online services.</description>

      <title>ATF talk at NYCBSDCon 2008</title>

      <description>NYCBSDCon 2008 will take place in New York City on October 11th and 12th. Given that I am already in NYC and will still be by that time, I submitted a presentation proposal about ATF. I have just been notified that my proposal has been accepted and, therefore, I will be giving a talk on ATF itself and how it relates to NetBSD on one of those two days. The conference program and schedule have not been published yet, though, so keep tuned.</description>
