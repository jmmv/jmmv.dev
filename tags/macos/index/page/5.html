The build of the app was failing with an errSecInternalComponent error printed by codesign.

Sandboxing can restrict file system accesses on a path level, control which host/port pairs can be reached over the network, limit which binaries can be executed, and much more. All applications installed via the App Store are subject to sandboxing.
This sandboxing functionality is exposed via the sandbox-exec(1) command-line utility, which unfortunately has been listed as deprecated for at least the last two major versions of macOS.</p><p class=text-muted>November 1, 2019

One example is the output tree, which naturally contains all the artifacts of your build. Another, more problematic example is the symlink forest trees created for every action when sandboxing is enabled. As garbage gets created, it must be deleted.
It turns out, however, that deleting file system trees can be very expensive&mdash;and especially so on macOS. In fact, calls to our deleteTree algorithm routinely showed up in my profiling runs when trying to diagnose slowdowns using the dynamic scheduler.</p><p class=text-muted>March 22, 2019

Similarly, after the introduction of the dynamic spawn scheduler, some users reported slower builds than pure remote or pure local builds, which made no sense.
All along we guessed that these problems were caused by Bazel&rsquo;s abuse of system threads, as it used to spawn 200 runnable threads during analysis and used to run 200 concurrent compiler subprocesses.</p><p class=text-muted>March 6, 2019

A consequence of using a monorepo is that some builds will become very large. And large builds can be very resource hungry, especially when using a tool like Bazel that tries to parallelize as many actions as possible for efficiency reasons.

I had to work on some university assignments and started to play a bit with Haskell, which made me start a rewrite of an utility (more on this soon, I hope!).
Let&rsquo;s now compare the development platform provided by these operating systems. This is something most end users will not ever care about, but it certainly affects the availability of some applications (specially commercial ones), their future evolution and how the applications work e.</p><p class=text-muted>October 20, 2006

Given the origins and spirit of each OS, the amount of commercial applications available for them is vastly different.
Let&rsquo;s start with Ubuntu (strictly speaking, Linux). Although trends are slowly changing, the number of commercial programs that are addressed to Linux systems is really small.</p><p class=text-muted>October 7, 2006

Therefore it keeps the philosophy of the two, being itself also free. Summarizing, this means that the user can legally modify and copy the system at will, without having to pay anyone for doing so. When things break, it is great to be able to look at the source code, find the problem and fix it yourself; of course, this is not something that end users will ever do, but I have found this situation valuable many times (not under Ubuntu though).</p><p class=text-muted>October 3, 2006

A desktop OS should provide a way to painlessly update your system (and possibly your applications) to the latest available versions; the main reason is to be safe to exploits that could damage your software and/or data.
Both Mac OS X and Ubuntu provide tools to keep themselves updated and, to some extent, their applications too.</p><p class=text-muted>October 2, 2006

Although systems such as pkgsrc&mdash;which build software from its source code&mdash;are very convenient some times, they get really annoying on desktops because problems pop up more often than desired and builds take hours to complete. In my opinion, a desktop end user must not ever need to build software by himself; if he needs to, someone in the development chain failed.</p><p class=text-muted>October 1, 2006

Some details will be left for further posts as they are interesting enough on their own. Here we go:
Ubuntu 6.06 LTS desktop (Gnome 2.x) showing a file manager window (Nautilus), the desktop background picker, and a web browser (Epiphany). Ubuntu, being yet another GNU/Linux distribution, uses one of the desktop environments available for this operating system, namely GNOME.</p><p class=text-muted>September 30, 2006

In order to be efficient, a desktop OS needs to handle most of the machine&rsquo;s hardware out of the box with no user intervention. It also has to deal with hotplug events transparently so that pen drives, cameras, MP3 players, etc. can be connected and start to work magically. We can&rsquo;t forget power management, which is getting more and more important lately even on desktop systems: being able to suspend the machine during short breaks instead of powering it down is extremely convenient.</p><p class=text-muted>September 29, 2006

With &ldquo;other work&rdquo; I&rsquo;m referring to Boost.Process and, most importantly, university assignments. Given my painless experience with the iBook G4 laptop I&rsquo;ve had for around a year, I was decided to replace the desktop machine with a Mac&mdash;most likely a brand-new iMac 20"&mdash;to run Mac OS X on top of it exclusively&mdash;OK, OK, alongside Windows XP to satisfy the eventual willingness to play some games.</p><p class=text-muted>September 28, 2006
