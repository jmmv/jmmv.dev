Now is the time to investigate this same topic on macOS. Remember that the problem we are trying to solve (#10245) is the following: given a process group, wait for all of its processes to fully terminate.
macOS has a bunch of fancy features that other systems do not have, but process control is not among them. We do not have features like Linux&rsquo;s child subreaper or PID namespaces to keep track of process groups. Therefore, we&rsquo;ll have to roll our own. And the only way to do this is to scan the process table looking for processes with the desired process group identifier (PGID) and waiting until they are gone.</p><p class=text-muted>November 15, 2019

Sandboxing can restrict file system accesses on a path level, control which host/port pairs can be reached over the network, limit which binaries can be executed, and much more. All applications installed via the App Store are subject to sandboxing.
This sandboxing functionality is exposed via the sandbox-exec(1) command-line utility, which unfortunately has been listed as deprecated for at least the last two major versions of macOS. It is still there, however, and the supplemental manual pages like sandbox(7) or sandboxd(8) do not mention the deprecation&mldr; which makes me think that the new App Sandboxing feature is built on the same kernel subsystem as sandbox-exec(1).</p><p class=text-muted>November 1, 2019

One example is the output tree, which naturally contains all the artifacts of your build. Another, more problematic example is the symlink forest trees created for every action when sandboxing is enabled. As garbage gets created, it must be deleted.
It turns out, however, that deleting file system trees can be very expensive&mdash;and especially so on macOS. In fact, calls to our deleteTree algorithm routinely showed up in my profiling runs when trying to diagnose slowdowns using the dynamic scheduler. One thing I quickly wondered is: why can I easily catch Bazel stuck in the tree deletion but I can never catch it busily creating such a tree? Is tree deletion inherently slow or are we doing something stupid?</p><p class=text-muted>March 22, 2019

Similarly, after the introduction of the dynamic spawn scheduler, some users reported slower builds than pure remote or pure local builds, which made no sense.
All along we guessed that these problems were caused by Bazel&rsquo;s abuse of system threads, as it used to spawn 200 runnable threads during analysis and used to run 200 concurrent compiler subprocesses. We tackled the problem by reducing Bazel&rsquo;s abuse (e.g. commit ac88041) of system resources&mldr; and while we saw an improvement, the issue remained.</p><p class=text-muted>March 6, 2019

This may seem annoying to some, but once you get used to it it becomes second nature. The reason I do this is to prevent the chance of a malicious coworker (or "guest") to steal my credentials at work.
However, Mac OS X has traditionally not made this simple. As far as I know, the only easy way to manually launch the screensaver was (and still is) to define a hot corner to put the display to sleep. Frankly, I don't want a hot corner action for this, if only because I already have assigned other actions to every corner of my screen. However, an icon in the dock would be very convenient... and this post teaches you the non-obvious way to achieve it.</p><p class=text-muted>November 7, 2013

But this time I decided to split the disk into multiple partitions for Mac OS X, to avoid external fragmentation slowdowns as much as possible.
I already did such a thing back when the MBP was new. At that time, I created a partition for the system files and another for the user data. However, that setup was not too optimal and, when I got the 7200RPM hard disk drive six months later, I reinstalled again in a single partition. Just for convenience.
But external fragmentation hurts performance a lot, specially in my case because I need to keep lots of small files (the NetBSD source tree, for example) and files that get fragmented very easily (sparse virtual machine disks). These end up spreading the files everywhere on the physical disk, and as a result the system slows down considerably. I even bought iDefrag and it does a good job at optimizing the disk layout... but the results were not as impressive as I expected.
This time I reinstalled using the following layout:
System: Mounted on /, HFS+ case insensitive, 30GB.Users: Mounted on /Users, HFS+ case insensitive, 50GB.Windows: Not mounted, NTFS, 40GB.Projects: Mounted on /Users/jmmv/Projects, HFS+ case sensitive, 30GB.Windows had to go before Projects so that the MBR partition table was constructed correctly; otherwise Windows failed to start after installation. The Projects partition holds those small files as well as the virtual machines. And Users keeps all the personal stuff such as photos, music and documents, which are mostly static.
Using this layout, the machine really feels a lot faster. Applications start quickly, programs that deal with personal data such as iPhoto and iTunes load the library faster, and I don't have to deal with stupid disk images to keep things sequential on disk. However, the price to pay for such layout is convenience, because now the free disk space is spread in multiple partitions.</p><p class=text-muted>July 5, 2008

Today, there was an excellent one titled Getting started with Cocoa: a friendlier approach posted at Andy Matuschak's blog: Square Signals.
This post guides you through your first steps with Cocoa. Its basic aim is making you gain enough intuition to let you guide yourself through Cocoa documentation in the future. If you have ever programmed in, e.g. Java, you know what this means: you first need to have some basic knowledge of the whole platform to get started and, at that point, you can do almost anything by driving to the API documentation and searching for what you need &mdash; even if you had no clue on how to accomplish your task before.
Attacking the in-depth documentation directly is hard because it overwhelms you with details that are not important to the beginner. Plus it does not show you the big picture.
I am by no means a Cocoa expert yet (in fact I'm very much a beginner), so this post will be extremely helpful to me, at least; thanks Andy! I hope it is to you too in case you wanted to begin programming for Mac OS X.</p><p class=text-muted>September 11, 2007

This is a must-have feature for laptops, but is also convenient for desktop machines. However, it hasn't been since the transition to Intel-based Macs that it also supports hibernation, also called deep sleep. When entering the hibernation mode, the system stores all memory contents to disk as well as the status of the devices. It then powers off the machine completely. Later on, the on-disk copy is used to restore the machine to its previous state when it is powered on. It takes longer than resuming from sleep status, but all your applications will be there as you left them.
Now, every time you put your Intel Mac to sleep it is also preparing itself to hibernate. This is why Intel Macs take longer than PowerPC-based ones to enter the sleep mode. This way, if the machine's battery drains completely in the case of notebooks, or the machine is unplugged in the case of desktops, the machine will be able to quickly recover itself to a safe state and you won't lose data.
As I mentioned yesterday, I've been running my MacBook Pro for a while without the battery, so I had an easy chance to experiment hibernation. And it's marvelous. No flaws so far.
The thing is that I always powered down my Mac at night. The reason is that putting it to sleep during the whole night consumed few but enough battery to require a recharge next morning to bring it back to 100%, so I didn't do it. But now I usually put it to hibernate; this way, on the next boot, I can continue work straight from where I left it and I don't have to restart any applications.
Now... putting a Mac notebook into this mode is painful if you have to remove the battery every time to force it to enter hibernation mode, and unfortunately Mac OS X does not have any "Hibernate" option. But... there is this sweet DashBoard widget called Deep Sleep that lets you do exactly that! No more boots from cold state any more :-)</p><p class=text-muted>July 28, 2007

It hasn't been until today that I realized that there is a new cool preferences panel called Processor:
It looks like this:
As you can see, it gives information about each processor in the machine and also lets you disable any processor you want.
There is also another "hidden" window, accessible from the menu bar control after you have enabled it. It is called the Processor palette and looks like this:
I already monitor the processor activity by using the Activity Monitor's dock icon, which is much more compact, but this one is nice :-)
Edit (16:22): Rui Paulo writes in a comment that this is available if you install Xcode. It turns out I have had Xcode installed for ages, but my installation did not contain the CHUD tools. I recently added them to the system, which must be the reason behind this new item in the system preferences.

I feel it is a good time for another mini-review.
Well... to get started: this machine is great; I probably haven't been happier with any other computer before. I have been able to work on real stuff &mdash; instead of maintaining the machine &mdash; during these months without a hitch. Strictly speaking I've got a couple of problems... but that was "my fault" for installing experimental kernel drivers.
As regards the machine's speed, which I think is the main reason why I wanted to write this post: it is pretty impressive considering it is a laptop. With a good amount of RAM, programs behave correctly and games can be played at high quality settings with a decent FPS rate. But, and everything has a "but": I really, really, really hate its hard disk (a 160 GB, 5400 RPM drive). I cannot stress that more. It's slow. Painfully slow under medium load. Seek times are horrible. That alone makes me feel I'm using a 10 year-old machine. I'm waiting for the shiny-new big 7200 RPM drives to become a bit easier to purchase and will make the switch, even if that means my battery life will be a bit shorter.
About Mac OS X... what can I say that you already don't know. It is very comfortable for daily use &mdash; although that's very subjective, of course; it's quite "funny" to read some reviews that blame OS X for not behaving exactly like Windows &mdash; and, being based on Unix, allows me to do serious development with a sane command-line environment and related tools. Parallels Desktop for Mac is my preferred tool so far as I can seamlessly work with Windows-only programs and do Linux/NetBSD development, but other free applications are equally great; some worth of mention: Adium X, Camino or QuickSilver.
At last, sometimes I miss having a desktop computer at home because watching TV series/movies on the laptop is rather annoying &mdash; I have to keep adjusting the screen's position so it's properly visible when laying on bed. I can imagine that an iMac with the included remote control and Front Row could be awesome for this specific use.
All in all, don't hesitate to buy this machine if you are considering it as a laptop or desktop replacement. But be sure to pick the new 7200 RPM drive if you will be doing any slightly-intensive disk operation.</p><p class=text-muted>June 21, 2007

I also have some virtual machines in Parallels that need to use these project's files.
In order to keep disk usage to the minimum, I share the project's disk images with the virtual machines by means of NFS. (See Mac OS X as an NFS Server for more details.) But in doing so, a problem appears: the NFS daemon is started as part of the system's boot process, long before I can manually mount the disk images. As a result, the NFS daemon â€” more specifically, mountd â€” cannot see the exported directories and assumes that their corresponding export entries are invalid. This effectively means that, after mounting the images, I have to manually send a HUP signal to mountd to refresh its export list.
A little research will tell you that it is trivial to mount disk volumes on login by dragging their icon to the Login items section of the Accounts preference panel:
But... that doesn't solve the problem. If you do that, the images will be mounted when you log in, and that happens long after the system has spawned the NFS daemons.
Ideally, one should be able to list the disk images in /etc/fstab, just as is done with any other file system, but that does not work (or I don't know the appropriate syntax). So how do you resolve the problem? Or better said, how did I resolve it (because I doubt it's the only solution)?
It turns out it was not trivial: you need to manually write a new startup script that mounts the images for you on system startup. In order to do that, start by creating the /Library/StartupItems/DiskImages directory; this will hold the startup script as well as the necessary meta-data to tell the system what to do with it.
Then create the real script within that directory and name it DiskImages:#! /bin/sh
#
# DiskImages startup script
#
. /etc/rc.common
basePath="/Library/StartupItems/DiskImages"
StartService() {
hdiutil attach -nobrowse /Users/jmmv/Projects/NetBSD.dmg
hdiutil attach -nobrowse /Users/jmmv/Projects/pkgsrc.dmg
}
StopService() {
true
}
RestartService() {
true
}
RunService "$1"Don't forget to grant the executable permission to that script with chmod +x DiskImages.
At last, create the StartupParameters.plist file, also in that directory, and put the following in it:{
Description = "Automatic attachment of disk images";
OrderPreference = "First";
Uses = ("Disks");
}And that's it! Reboot and those exported directories contained within images will be properly recognized by the NFS daemon.
I'm wondering if there is a better way to resolve the issue, but so far this seems to work. Now... mmm... a UI to create and manage this script could be sweet.</p><p class=text-muted>April 10, 2007

Journaling is a very nice feature as it allows a quick recovery of the file system&rsquo;s status should anything bad happen to the machine â€” e.g. a power failure or a crash. With a journaled file system, the operating system can easily undo or redo the last operations executed on the disk without losing meta-data, effectively avoiding a full file system check.</p><p class=text-muted>April 9, 2007

Formatting them as FAT (in any of its versions) is suboptimal due to the deficiencies of this file system: big clusters, lack of journaling support, etc. But, like it or not, FAT is the most compatible file system out there: virtually any OS and device supports it in read/write mode.
Today, I had to reinstall Windows XP on my Mac (won't bother you with the reasons). In the past, I had used FAT32 for its 30Gb partition so I could access it from Mac OS X. But recently, some guys at Google ported Linux's FUSE to Mac OS X, effectively allowing anyone to use FUSE modules under this operating system. And you guessed right: there is a module that provides stable, full read/write support for NTFS file systems; it's name: ntfs-3g.
So I installed Windows XP on a NTFS partition and gave these a try.
MacFUSE, as said above, is a port of Linux's FUSE kernel-level interface to Mac OS X. For those that don't know it, FUSE is a kernel facility that allows file system drivers to be run as user-space applications; this speeds up development of these components and also prevents some common programming mistakes to take the whole system down. Having such a compatible interface means that you can run almost any FUSE module under Mac OS X without changes to its code.
Installing MacFUSE is trivial, but I was afraid that using ntfs-3g could require messing with the command line â€” which would be soooo Mac-unlike â€” and feared it could not integrate well with the system (i.e. no automation nor replacement of the standard read-only driver).
It turns out I was wrong. There is a very nice NTFS-3G for Mac OS X project that provides you the typical disk image with a couple of installers to properly merge ntfs-3g support into your system. Once done, just reboot and your NTFS partition will automatically come up in the Finder as a read/write volume! Sweet. Kudos to the developers that made this work.
Oh, and by the way. We have got FUSE support in NetBSD too!</p><p class=text-muted>March 17, 2007

One could think they are effectively the same because, with the switch to a Unix base in version 10.0, symbolic links became a &ldquo;normal thing&rdquo; in the system. However, for better or worse, differences still remain; let&rsquo;s see them.
Symbolic links can only be created from the command line by using the ln(1) utility. Once created, the Finder will represent them as aliases (with a little arrow in their icon&rsquo;s lower-left corner) and treat them as such. A symbolic link is stored on disk as a non-empty file which contains the full or relative path to the file it points to; then, the link&rsquo;s inode is marked as special by activating its symbolic link flag. (This is how things work in UFS; I suspect HFS+ is similar, but cannot confirm it.)</p><p class=text-muted>January 20, 2007

I find these items useless: why should I care about a part of the file system being stored in a different partition? (Note that this has nothing to do with icons for removable media and external drives, a these really are useful.)
The removal of the extra volumes from the sidebars is trivial: just right-click (or Control+click) on the drive entry and select the Remove from Sidebar option.
But how to deal with the icons on the desktop? One possibility is to open the Finder's preferences and tell it to not show entries for hard disks. The downside is that all direct accesses to the file system will disappear, including those that represent external disks.
A slightly better solution is to mark the volume's mount point as hidden, which will effectively make it invisible to the Finder. To do this you have to set the invisible extended attribute on the folder by using the SetFile(1) utility (stored in /Developer/Tools, thus included in Xcode). For example, to hide our example /Users mount point:# /Developer/Tools/SetFile -a V /UsersYou'll need to relaunch the Finder for the changes to take effect.
The above is not perfect, though: the mount point will be hidden from all Finder windows, not only from the desktop. I don't know if there is any better way to achieve this, but this one does the trick...</p><p class=text-muted>January 16, 2007

Among other things, this means that there is a single virtual file system on which you can attach new volumes by means of mount points and the mount(8) utility. One could consider partitioning a disk to place specific system areas in different partitions to prevent the degradation of each file system, but the installer does not let you do this (I suspect the one for Mac OS X Server might have this feature, but this is just a guess). Being Unix, this doesn't mean it isn't possible!
As a demonstration, I explain here how to install Mac OS X so that the system files are placed in one partition and the users' home directories are in another one. This setup keeps mostly-static system data self contained in a specific area of the disk and allows you to do a clean system reinstall without losing your data nor settings.
First of all boot the installation from the first DVD and execute the Disk Utility from the Utilities menu. There you can partition your disk as you want, so create a partition for the system and one for the users; let's call them System and Users respectively, being on the disk0s2 and disk0s3 devices. Both should be HFS+, but you can choose whether you want journaling and/or case sensitivity independently. Exit the tool and go back to the installer.
Now do a regular install on the System volume, ignoring the existence of Users. To make things simple, go through the whole installation, including the welcome wizard. Once you are in the default desktop, get ready for the tricky stuff.
Reboot your machine and enter single user mode by pressing and holding Command+s just after the initial chime sound. At the command line, follow the instructions to remount the root volume as read/write. If I recall correctly, it tells you to do:# fsck -fy /
# mount -u rw /Mount the Users volume in a temporary location, copy the current contents of /Users into it and remove the original files. For example:# mkdir /Users2
# mount -t hfs /dev/disk0s3 /Users2
# rsync -avE /Users/ /Users2
... ensure that /Users2 matches /Users ...
# rm -rf /Users/.[a-zA-Z_]* /Users/*
# umount /Users2
# rmdir /Users2I used rsync(1) instead of cp(1) because it preserves the files' resource forks, if present (provided you give it the -E option).
Once the data migration is done, you can proceed to tell the system to mount the Users volume in the appropriate place on the next boot. Create the /etc/fstab file and add the following line to it:/dev/disk0s3 /Users hfs rwEnsure it works by mounting it by hand:# mount /UsersIf no problems arise, you're done! Reboot and enjoy your new system.
The only problem with the above strategy is that your root volume must be big enough to hold the whole installation before you can reorganize the partitions. I haven't tried it but maybe, just maybe, you could do some manual mounts from within the Terminal available in the installer. That way you'd set up the desired mount layout before any files are copied, delivering the appropriate results. Note that if this worked, you'd still need to do the fstab trick in this case, but you'd have to do it on the very first reboot, even before the install is complete!</p><p class=text-muted>January 15, 2007

Given the origins and spirit of each OS, the amount of commercial applications available for them is vastly different.
Let&rsquo;s start with Ubuntu (strictly speaking, Linux). Although trends are slowly changing, the number of commercial programs that are addressed to Linux systems is really small. I&rsquo;ve reasons to believe that this is because Linux, as a platform to provide such applications, is awful. We already saw an example of this in the software installation comparison because third-party applications have a hard path to distribute their software under the Linux world. We will see more examples about this soon in another post.</p><p class=text-muted>October 7, 2006

Both Mac OS X and Ubuntu provide tools to keep themselves updated and, to some extent, their applications too.

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS desktop (Gnome 2.x) showing a file manager window (Nautilus), the desktop background picker, and a web browser (Epiphany). Ubuntu, being yet another GNU/Linux distribution, uses one of the desktop environments available for this operating system, namely GNOME. GNOME aims to be an environment that is easy to use and doesn&rsquo;t get in your way; they are achieving it.
