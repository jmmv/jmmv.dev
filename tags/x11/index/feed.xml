      <description>Almost two years ago, I stopped using white on black terminal windows. I found that such a setup strained my eyesight significantly and disturbed my focus. However, the complete opposite — black on white — is not much better after staring at the screen for hours: a yellowish tinted background works much better in my personal case.
The OS X Terminal emulator comes with a color set that I find quite pleasant: Novel.</description>

      <description>I recently installed NetBSD-current (4.99.12 at the time I did this) inside Parallels Desktop for Mac. Everything went fine except for the configuration of the XFree86 shipped with the base system: I was unable to get high resolutions to work (over 1024x768 if I recall correctly), and I wanted to configure a full-screen desktop. In my specific case, this is 1440x900, the MacBook Pro&#39;s native resolution.
It turns out I had to manually add a mode line to the XF86Config file to get that resolution detected.</description>
