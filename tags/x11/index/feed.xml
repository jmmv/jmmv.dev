It reminded me of QuickBASIC, which is what the whole program is supposed to do, but the colors felt vivid and modern. Take a look:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Naturally,&amp;rdquo; I wondered if I could adopt those colors in VSCode and Windows Terminal, as these are the apps I look at the most throughout a work day. I quickly ruled out VSCode because defining a theme seems non-trivial, but creating a scheme for Windows Terminal was very easy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Novel color scheme for xterm</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/novel-color-scheme-for-xterm.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2013 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/novel-color-scheme-for-xterm.html</guid><description>Almost two years ago, I stopped using white on black terminal windows. I found that such a setup strained my eyesight significantly and disturbed my focus. However, the complete opposite&amp;mdash;black on white&amp;mdash;is not much better after staring at the screen for hours: a yellowish tinted background works much better in my personal case.
The OS X Terminal emulator comes with a color set that I find quite pleasant: Novel. It is a &amp;ldquo;light background&amp;rdquo;, low-contrast theme so it is easier on the my eyes.</description></item><item><title>X11 mode-line generator</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/03/x11-mode-line-generator.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2007 13:33:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/03/x11-mode-line-generator.html</guid><description>I recently installed NetBSD-current (4.99.12 at the time I did this) inside Parallels Desktop for Mac. Everything went fine except for the configuration of the XFree86 shipped with the base system: I was unable to get high resolutions to work (over 1024x768 if I recall correctly), and I wanted to configure a full-screen desktop. In my specific case, this is 1440x900, the MacBook Pro's native resolution.
It turns out I had to manually add a mode line to the XF86Config file to get that resolution detected.</description></item></channel></rss>
