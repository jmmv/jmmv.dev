It reminded me of QuickBASIC, which is what the whole program is supposed to do, but the colors felt vivid and modern. Take a look:&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Naturally,&amp;rdquo; I wondered if I could adopt those colors in VSCode and Windows Terminal, as these are the apps I look at the most throughout a work day. I quickly ruled out VSCode because defining a theme seems non-trivial, but creating a scheme for Windows Terminal was very easy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Novel color scheme for xterm</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/novel-color-scheme-for-xterm.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2013 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/novel-color-scheme-for-xterm.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Almost two years ago, I stopped using white on black terminal windows. I found that such a setup strained my eyesight significantly and disturbed my focus. However, the complete opposite&amp;mdash;black on white&amp;mdash;is not much better after staring at the screen for hours: a yellowish tinted background works much better in my personal case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The OS X Terminal emulator comes with a color set that I find quite pleasant: &lt;strong>Novel&lt;/strong>. It is a &amp;ldquo;light background&amp;rdquo;, low-contrast theme so it is easier on &lt;s>the&lt;/s> my eyes. Here is how it looks like:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>X11 mode-line generator</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/03/x11-mode-line-generator.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Mar 2007 13:33:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/03/x11-mode-line-generator.html</guid><description>I recently installed NetBSD-current (4.99.12 at the time I did this) inside Parallels Desktop for Mac. Everything went fine except for the configuration of the XFree86 shipped with the base system: I was unable to get high resolutions to work (over 1024x768 if I recall correctly), and I wanted to configure a full-screen desktop. In my specific case, this is 1440x900, the MacBook Pro's native resolution.&lt;br />&lt;br />It turns out I had to manually add a mode line to the XF86Config file to get that resolution detected. I bet recent X.Org versions do not need this as, e.g. Fedora Core 6 works fine without manual fiddling.&lt;br />&lt;br />Writing mode lines is not fun, but fortunately I came across an automated generator. In fact, this seems to be just a web-based &lt;a href="http://www.sh.nu/nvidia/gtf.php">frontend to the gtf tool&lt;/a> provided by NVIDIA. So I entered the appropriate details (x = 1440, y = 900, refresh = 60), hit the &lt;i>Generate modeline&lt;/i> button and got:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;tt># 1440x900 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 55.92 kHz; pclk: 106.47 MHz&lt;br />&lt;br />Modeline "1440x900_60.00" 106.47 1440 1520 1672 1904 900 901 904 932 -HSync +Vsync&lt;/tt>&lt;br />&lt;br />After that I had to make the &lt;tt>HorizSync&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>VertRefresh&lt;/tt> values in my configuration file a bit wider to fulfill this mode's request and everything worked fine. Be extremely careful if you mess with synchronization values though; incorrect ones can physically damage a monitor, although I &lt;i>think&lt;/i> this is not a problem for LCDs.</description></item></channel></rss>
