DEBUG.EXE is being finally phased out in Windows 7. I can't believe it was still there.
This brings me back two different memories. I had used this program in the past (a long while ago!) and it caused me both pain and joy.
Regarding pain: I had an MS-DOS 5.x book that spent a whole section on DEBUG.EXE, and one of the examples in it contained a command that caused the program in memory to be written to some specific sectors of the floppy disk.</description></item></channel></rss>
