      <description>Yesterday night I finished playing &#34;Resistance: Fall of Man&#34;, a game that came with the PlayStation 3 Starter Pack I bought. It was not as long as I expected but found it to be a very good game. The storytelling, sound and gameplay was nice, but I cannot judge the graphics. I already showed you the crappy monitor used with the PS3... so I&#39;ll surely go through the whole game again when I get a nicer screen.</description>

      <description>As I told you a couple of weeks ago, I bought Doom 3: Resurrection of evil, which I have just finished it. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is more of the same Doom 3: dark and scary scenarios, lots of monsters and the same game-play.
However, I find it more balanced than the original Doom 3. Overall, the game is shorter as well as each of its chapters. I started playing a chapter a day, then stopped for several days while I was busy with other stuff and today I played the last four chapters in two runs.</description>

      <description>It has taken me around two years but, a week ago, I finally completed Doom 3. The game is good, although not excellent. Let&#39;s see why:
On the first hand, the game is frightening. Yes, it is. I didn&#39;t believe it before playing, but once you get immersed in the game, it really becomes so. For the best experience, turn off your lights, rise the volume and, of course, play alone.</description>
