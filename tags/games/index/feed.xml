It was not as long as I expected but found it to be a very good game. The storytelling, sound and gameplay was nice, but I cannot judge the graphics. I already &lt;a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2007/10/got-it-ps3.html">showed you the crappy monitor&lt;/a> used with the PS3... so I'll surely go through the whole game again when I get a nicer screen.&lt;br />&lt;br />One specific thing I liked, when comparing it to other FPS such as Doom 3 or F.E.A.R., was that you barely have to use the flashlight, which in other games gets boring after a while. Well... I guess this is because Resistance was not meant to be a frightening game, as those other two are. Another point in favor is that the game has a nice set of guns, some of which are pretty original and different to all other games I've seen in this area. And it's hard to run out of ammo, at least in the most basic (but useful) guns.&lt;br />&lt;br />Speaking of other games, there are some levels that will remind you a lot to Call of Duty, and some others to Half Life 2. Not bad, but seems like developers of FPS are running out of ideas.&lt;br />&lt;br />To conclude, let me say that playing with the Sixaxis controller, as opposed to a keyboard plus mouse, was extra nice. It was very difficult to get used to it, but in the end makes for a good gaming experience. I'm now willing to try Metroid Prime 3 or Red Stell on the Wii with its Wiimote, which surely are better in this regard.&lt;br />&lt;br />Recommended game :-)</description></item><item><title>Games: Doom 3: Resurrection of evil</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/04/games-doom-3-resurrection-of-evil.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Apr 2007 15:39:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/04/games-doom-3-resurrection-of-evil.html</guid><description>As I told you &lt;a href="http://www2.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=17885055">a couple of weeks ago&lt;/a>, I bought &lt;a href="http://www.doom3.com/">Doom 3: Resurrection of evil&lt;/a>, which I have just finished it. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is more of the same Doom 3: dark and scary scenarios, lots of monsters and the same game-play.&lt;br />&lt;br />However, I find it more balanced than the original Doom 3. Overall, the game is shorter as well as each of its chapters. I started playing a chapter a day, then stopped for several days while I was busy with other stuff and today I played the last four chapters in two runs. This makes it more fun to play, because as you notice you are reaching the end you want to see it as soon as possible (as happened to me).&lt;br />&lt;br />Then there are some annoying new monsters, but they are not strong ones. There are also some new guns, such as the double shotgun from the original Doom, a Half Life 2's gravity-gun-like thing and The Artifact, which replaces the Soul's Cube; mmm, I think I preferred the latter.&lt;br />&lt;br />At last, the storyline is so thin that you don't get involved, but it doesn't matter because the game is very linear and thus you can't get stalled nor lost. Just keep going and killing everything in your way.&lt;br />&lt;br />Summarizing, you'll certainly enjoy it if you liked the original Doom 3. I'm wondering which game I can get now given that Half Life 2: Episode 2 is delayed!</description></item><item><title>Games: Doom 3</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/03/games-doom-3.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Mar 2007 14:45:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/03/games-doom-3.html</guid><description>It has taken me around two years but, a week ago, I finally completed &lt;a href="http://www.doom3.com/">Doom 3&lt;/a>. The game is good, although not excellent. Let's see why:&lt;br />&lt;br />On the first hand, the game is frightening. Yes, it is. I didn't believe it before playing, but once you get &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">immersed&lt;/span> in the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">game&lt;/span>, it really becomes so. For the best experience, turn off your lights, rise the volume and, of course, play alone. If you like horror games or movies, you'll certainly enjoy this one.&lt;br />&lt;br />The ambient at the beginning of the game is neat. You have few &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">ammo&lt;/span>, you discover new monsters, you hear screams through radio transmissions... Easy to get "involved". As you progress, you'll learn about the game's plot basically through other people's &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">PDAs&lt;/span>, which hold mails and voice messages. These are also recorded in a way to increase tension, as in some way they outline what will happen soon you go on.&lt;br />&lt;br />On the graphics area, it is very good, even though it requires a good amount of resources. I have finished it at high quality and there certainly are a lot of details in the images, plus a lot of neat effects. As regards sounds, they are very well placed to create a horror ambient. I think some background voices were much better in the English version (the one I started playing) than in the Spanish one, but it has been so long that I cannot tell for sure.&lt;br />&lt;br />Let's now see the negative side: the game is too repetitive and too long. That's why it has taken me so long to finish it: I've played it in four runs, because after each one I was too bored to continue playing. Well, being too long wouldn't be bad if there was more variety in the levels... in fact, I'm not sure it's that long, but it seemed so. For example, the Delta Labs seem infinite.&lt;br />&lt;br />Also, once you get to the Hell level and onwards, you find so many monsters that it becomes not so frightening. It is more a "shoot everything that moves and run" than "go slowly to see what may happen" as is at the first half of the game.&lt;br />&lt;br />Summarizing, it has more pros than cons, so it's worth it. If not, I wouldn't have just got the expansion pack, &lt;a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/games/doom/doom3-roe/">Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil&lt;/a>!</description></item></channel></rss>
