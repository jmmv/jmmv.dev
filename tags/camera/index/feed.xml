This is my first "decent" digital camera, and I'm looking forward to learning the basics of photography with it.&lt;br />&lt;br />This camera is bigger than what I planned — it is not much smaller than the Kodak —, but, on the other hand, it offers lots of features worth having. To mention some: it has good lens quality, complete manual controls, optical image stabilization, a standard optical zoom (4x) and a very intuitive and easy-to-manage interface (but, of course, this last point is my personal opinion).&lt;br />&lt;br />I thought I could share some pictures of the mess my desktop currently is &amp;mdash. OK, OK, maybe it's not that messy; I have seen photos depicting much worse scenarios than this one. I wish mine could be similar to &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/glennwolsey/767801073/in/set-72157600744490072/">this one&lt;/a>, powered by a huge Apple Cinema Display and a Mac Pro, but I'm not there (yet!) ;-) The laptop and the desire to hack NetBSD on old computers makes keeping things tidy hard.&lt;br />&lt;br />So here we go: this is the main view, where you can easily see the MacBook Pro, an old Apple keyboard to the left and a relatively old PC on the right-low corner, connected to an old flat screen seen at the top-right corner. There is also too much garbage on top of the table that should not really be there: batteries, the speakers, papers... scissors?&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xLbGV919cEE/Rtv-MwjJcmI/AAAAAAAAABc/BQrXAiycqaM/s1600-h/IMG_0100.JPG">&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://jmmv.dev/images/2007-09-03-IMG_0100.JPG" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />And here you can see the "vintage corner", currently composed of a couple of old Macintoshes (68040-powered) and a DNARD (also known as a "shark"). There are also a couple of USB hard disks, but those are not old ;-)&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xLbGV919cEE/Rtv-NAjJcnI/AAAAAAAAABk/PBhR1Eman4c/s1600-h/IMG_0101.JPG">&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://jmmv.dev/images/2007-09-03-IMG_0101.JPG" />&lt;/a></description></item></channel></rss>
