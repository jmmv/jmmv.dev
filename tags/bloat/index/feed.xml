      <description>Out of boredom, I installed MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 on my machine a few days ago &amp;mdash; yeah, I was inspired by the Hot Dog Stand comments in this post. Check it out here. Don&#39;t be scared, it was just a virtual machine!
Anyway, this was fun because it reminded me of something. Back in 1994, my father bought a Pentium 60Mhz. After ordering it, we imagined how fast it could be compared to our older machine, a 386DX 40Mhz.</description>

      <title>Software bloat, 2</title>

      <description>A long while ago &amp;mdash; just before buying the MacBook Pro &amp;mdash; I already complained about software bloat. A year and two months later, it is time to complain again.
I am thinking on renewing my MacBook Pro assuming I can sell this one for a good price. The reasons for this are to get slightly better hardware (more disk, better GPU and maybe 4GB of RAM) and software updates. The problem is: if I am able to find a buyer, I will be left without a computer for some days, and that&#39;s not a good scenario.</description>

      <description>A bit more than three years ago, I renewed my main machine and bought an Athlon XP 2600+ with 512MB of RAM and a 80GB hard disk. The speed boost I noticed in games, builds and the overall system usage was incredible &amp;mdash; I was coming from a Pentium II 233 with 384MB of RAM.
With the change, I was finally able to switch from plain window managers to desktop environments (alternating KDE and GNOME from time to time) and still keep a usable machine.</description>
