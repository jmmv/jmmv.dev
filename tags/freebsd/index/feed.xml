&lt;p>But uh&amp;hellip; wait, what is Kyua and why is this exciting? To resolve confusion and celebrate this milestone, I&amp;rsquo;d like to revisit what Kyua is, how it came to be, why I stopped working on it for a while, why that was a problem for FreeBSD&amp;mdash;and, indirectly, NetBSD&amp;mdash;and how Kyua being free software has helped keep it alive.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-08-02-kyua-graduates.jpg" length="367311" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Speeding up autoconf with caching</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/06/autoconf-caching.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 06:30:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/06/autoconf-caching.html</guid><description>&lt;p>In the recent &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2022/05/remembering-buildtool.html">Remembering Buildtool&lt;/a> post, I described how setting up a cache of configuration checks was an important step in Buildtool&amp;rsquo;s installation process. The goal was to avoid pointless repetitive work on every build by performing such common checks once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.bsdnow.tv/457">Episode 457 of BSD Now&lt;/a> featured my post and Allan Jude wondered how much time would be saved in a bulk build of all FreeBSD packages if we could just do that same kind of caching with GNU Autoconf. And, you know what? It is indeed possible to do so. I had mentioned it en passing in my post but I guess I wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear enough, so let&amp;rsquo;s elaborate!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>rc.d belongs in libexec, not etc</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/rcd-libexec-etc.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 06:30:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/08/rcd-libexec-etc.html</guid><description>The scripts that live under /etc/rc.d/ in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD are in the wrong place.

that &lt;em>every change to the source tree &lt;strong>must&lt;/strong> be reviewed &lt;strong>before&lt;/strong>
commit&lt;/em>. It is hard to internalize such a workflow if you have never
been exposed to it, but given enough time —O(weeks) is my estimation—,
the formal pre-commit code review process becomes a habit and, soon
after, something you take for granted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To me, code reviews have become invaluable and, actually, I feel &amp;ldquo;naked&amp;rdquo;
when I work on open source projects where this process is not standard
practice. This is especially the case when developing my own, 1-person
projects, because there is nobody to bounce my code off for a quick
sanity-check. Fortunately, this may not be the case any more in, at
least, FreeBSD, and I am super-happy to see change happening.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Refocusing Kyua maybe?</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2014/05/refocusing-kyua-maybe.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2014 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2014/05/refocusing-kyua-maybe.html</guid><description>&lt;p>The FreeBSD devsummit that just passed by gave me enough insight into Jenkins to question the long-term plans for Kyua. Uh, &lt;i>WHAT&lt;/i>?! Let me explain.&lt;/p> &lt;p>&lt;b>In the beginning...&lt;/b>&lt;/p> &lt;p>One of the original but unstated goals of Kyua was to fix the "mess" that is the &lt;a href="http://releng.netbsd.org/test-results.html">NetBSD releng test run logs&lt;/a> site: if you pay close attention, you will notice that various individuals have reinvented the wheel over and over again in an attempt to &lt;i>automate release builds and test suite runs&lt;/i>. In other words: different parties have implemented independent continuous integration systems several times with more or less success.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BSDCan 2014 summary</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2014/05/bsdcan-2014-summary.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2014 18:50:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2014/05/bsdcan-2014-summary.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.bsdcan.org/2014/">BSDCan 2014&lt;/a> and the accompanying &lt;a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/DevSummit">FreeBSD devsummit&lt;/a> are officially over.

It is true that &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-1.html">I already visited a devsummit once&lt;/a> —the one in EuroBSDCon 2013—, but this is the first time I participate in the "real deal" while also being a committer.&lt;/p> &lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3PQD8mvKdXA/U30iTWjLA_I/AAAAAAAAMa4/RM0npPCidc0/s1600/IMG_20140518_085230124.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;">&lt;img border="0" src="https://jmmv.dev/images/2014-05-21-IMG_20140518_085230124.jpg" />&lt;/a>&lt;/div> &lt;p>The first impressive thing about this devsummit is that there were about 120 attendees. The vast majority of these were developers, of course, but there was also a reasonable presence from vendors — including, for example, delegates from Netflix, Isilon, NetApp and even smaller parties like Tarsnap.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GSoC 2014 idea: Port FreeBSD's old-style tests to ATF</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2014/03/gsoc-2014-idea-port-freebsds-old-style.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2014 08:22:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2014/03/gsoc-2014-idea-port-freebsds-old-style.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Are you a student interested in contributing to a production-quality operating system by increasing its overall quality?

That said, and because a major part of the tutorial will revolve around &lt;i>using&lt;/i> the test suite for one's own benefit, everyone is welcome really. In particular, system administrators may get a useful tool out of this.&lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;p>The main surprise in the acceptance confirmation email is that materials are due by January 20th... which is around the corner!

I was able to do so because one of the PC magazines that my father used to buy in 1999 came with a copy of FreeBSD 3.2 — pretty advanced stuff for a magazine compared to today's standards, huh? However, that first experience did not go very well: the system felt really sluggish... only because I did not know that I had to enable the magic &lt;tt>softdep&lt;/tt> option. So I gave up.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EuroBSDCon 2013 takeaways</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/eurobsdcon-2013-takeaways.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2013 08:03:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/eurobsdcon-2013-takeaways.html</guid><description>&lt;p>EuroBSDCon 2013 is done.

Only 15 to 20 minutes of discussion were necessary to learn a lot about how the OpenBSD project is run and to clear some of the misconceptions I had, which I don't know where I got from. One obvious example is that OpenBSD does support SMP and has in fact been doing so for a long time — except, of course, for the fact that the giant kernel lock is still being removed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Live from EuroBSDCon 2013, day 1</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-1.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2013 12:05:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-1.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello everyone!
