As I frantically typed that article while replying to angry tweets, the thought came to mind: software engineering as a whole is hyper-focused on lowering the costs to write new code, yet there is a disregard for the costs that these improvements bring to other disciplines in a company on even to end users.
So, in this series finale, I want to compare how some choices that apparently lower development costs actually increase costs elsewhere. I also want to highlight how, if we made different decisions during development, we could possibly expose those extra costs early on. This is beneficial because exposing costs upfront allows us to make tough choices when there is still a chance of changing course.
To make things specific, I will look at how the use of modern frameworks that facilitate development can end up hurting performance, reliability, and usability. So let&rsquo;s start with a three-part rant first (sorry) and then let&rsquo;s look at what we might do.</p><p class=text-muted>August 31, 2023

The idea I&rsquo;m trying to convey is hard to communicate in the abstract so, in that post, I used the differences between a monorepo and a multirepo setup as an example. Today, I&rsquo;ll expore a different scenario to support the same idea. I&rsquo;m going to talk about how certain ticket assignment practices during on-call operations can expose service support costs vs. how other practices hide them.
Keep in mind that, just like in the previous post, I do not want to compare the general merits of one approach vs. the other. The only thing I want to compare is whether one approach centralizes toil and allows management to quantify its cost vs. how another approach hides toil by smearing it over the whole team in hard-to-quantify ways. Whether management actually does something to correct the situation once the costs are exposed is a different story.</p><p class=text-muted>August 26, 2023

Unfortunately, because such practices feel more expensive, teams choose to keep their status quo even when they know it is suboptimal. This choice ends up hurting productivity and morale because planned work is continuously interrupted, which in turn drags project completion.
The reason I say seem and not are is because the alternatives to these cost-exposing practices also suffer from costs. The difference is that, while the former surface costs, leading to the need to allocate time and people to infrastructure work, the latter keeps the costs smeared over teams and individuals in ways that are difficult to account and plan for.
To illustrate what I&rsquo;m trying to say, I&rsquo;ll present three different scenarios in which this opinion applies. All of these case studies come from past personal experiences while working in different teams and projects. The first one covered in this post is about the adoption of a monorepo vs. the use of multiple different repositories. The other two will come in follow-up articles.</p><p class=text-muted>August 23, 2023

This looked like a bunch of Arc objects passed around and was done to support extremely fast unit testing.
When I generalized the core logic of these services into the III-IV framework, I decided to experiment with a switch to static dispatch. The rationale was that using static dispatch better aligns with the design of well-regarded crates in the Rust ecosystem, and also because I wanted to avoid unnecessary runtime costs in the foundational pieces of my web services.
Let me tell you that this decision was a huge mistake and that the experiment has utterly failed. Using static dispatch has been a constant source of frustration due to the difficulty in passing types around and reasoning about trait bounds. The situation had gotten so bad that I dreaded adding new functionality to my services whenever a change to a statically-typed struct was needed, because that meant adding yet another type parameter and plumbing it through tens of source files.
In lieu of the difficulties, which eventually turned into blockers to implementing new features, I made the choice of going back to dynamic dispatch. The goal was to gain ergonomics at the expense of a supposedly-negligible runtime cost. Let me tell you about the problems I faced, the refactoring journey, and some measurements I gathered after the rewrite.</p><p class=text-muted>August 6, 2023

To make things specific, I'll be describing the testing infrastructure of EndTRACKER, the EndBASIC Service, and the sample key/value store app of III-IV.

It is good practice to treat the CWD as read-only because it is essentially global state: if you change the CWD of your process at any point, any relative paths you might have stored in memory1 will stop working. I learned this first many years ago when using the Boost.Filesystem library: I could not find a function to change the CWD and that was very much intentional for this reason.</p><p class=text-muted>September 21, 2019

Errors are a controlled mechanism by which the program propagates details about a faulty condition up the call chain—be it with explicit error return statements or with exceptions. Errors must be used to validate all conditions that might be possible but aren&rsquo;t valid given the context. Examples include: sanitizing any kind of input (as provided by the user or incoming from the network), and handling error codes from system calls or libraries.</p><p class=text-muted>July 24, 2018

They are, however, vastly different. So let&rsquo;s give in and compare them anyway.</p><p class=text-muted>July 13, 2018

The book does a good job in general, but there are some things that could be better. Let&rsquo;s cover these, but first, some background.
A couple of years ago, right after getting started with Rust, I tried to go through the book&rsquo;s first few chapters. It all sounded cool&mldr; but the first edition of the book moved at a glacially slow pace because it covered things in excruciating detail.</p><p class=text-muted>June 19, 2018

As you write and read Rust, you will notice that this keyword is used everywhere because it&rsquo;s the way to access certain types, like Option values or error codes.
For example:
match node.get_parent() { // node is an Option&lt;Something>.</p><p class=text-muted>June 15, 2018

In fact, I have been thinking of Rust as a &ldquo;pragmatic Haskell&rdquo; or as a &ldquo;well-balanced mixture between C++ and Haskell&rdquo;.
One of the ways the functional aspects show up is via expressions and how pretty much any construct in Rust can be treated as an expression. But before we begin, a little warning: the examples below are, by no means, idiomatic Rust—I just hope they are simple enough to illustrate what I want to show.</p><p class=text-muted>June 12, 2018

Or is it? In this post, I&rsquo;ll try to convince you that the curve does feel steep, but it isn&rsquo;t when taken into perspective.
Let&rsquo;s first start by stating that learning a language is not the same as learning its syntax. Learning a language involves learning the syntax, of course, but it also involves familiarizing oneself with its common idioms and grabbing a good sense of what the standard libraries provide.</p><p class=text-muted>June 8, 2018

I had always thought of mutexes as something that is easy to get wrong and was convinced that the use of a RAII pattern to prevent lock leaks never happen (like with Abseil&rsquo;s MutexLock) was the panacea. (I&rsquo;m a fan of RAII in C++ by the way, in case you haven&rsquo;t noticed.)</p><p class=text-muted>June 5, 2018

To understand why this is important, let&rsquo;s cover some context first. One of my pet peeves when reviewing C++ code is to ask authors to sprinkle the const qualifier everywhere: if something ain&rsquo;t mutated, say so explicitly. This includes marking local variables, function arguments, function return values, class attributes, etc.</p><p class=text-muted>May 29, 2018

For example, for a Python script you would use #! /usr/bin/env python, and then the saying goes, the script would &ldquo;just work&rdquo; on any machine with Python installed.
The reason for this recommendation is that /usr/bin/env python will search the PATH for a program called python and execute the first one found&mldr; and that usually works fine on one&rsquo;s own machine.</p><p class=text-muted>September 14, 2016
