The claim was that we needed to set up containers in our developer machines in order to run tests against a modern glibc. The justifications were that using <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to load a different glibc didn&rsquo;t work and statically linking glibc wasn&rsquo;t possible either.</p><p>But&mldr; running a program against a version of glibc that&rsquo;s different from the one installed on the system seems like a pretty standard requirement, doesn&rsquo;t it? Consider this: how do the developers of glibc test their changes? glibc has existed for much longer than containers have. And before containers existed, they surely weren&rsquo;t testing glibc changes by installing modified versions of the library over the system-wide one and YOLOing it.</p></p><p class=text-muted>August 11, 2024

Rust is particularly well-suited at this task: its lack of implicit type conversions eliminates surprises, and its ownership semantics allow type transformations with zero cost.</p><p>Unfortunately, (ab)using narrow types in an app&rsquo;s domain is <em>really</em> annoying when writing tests. While non-test code rarely instantiates new objects&mdash;in the case of a REST service, this would only happen at the service&rsquo;s boundaries&mdash;tests instantiate objects infinitely more times than non-test code. Code patterns that may seem reasonable in non-test code can become unbearable in tests.</p><p>In this post, I want to look into the various ways in which you can instantiate strongly-typed objects. For each, I show examples and describe their pros and cons.

As I frantically typed that article while replying to angry tweets, the thought came to mind: software engineering as a whole is hyper-focused on lowering the costs to write new code, yet there is a disregard for the costs that these improvements bring to other disciplines in a company on even to end users.</p><p>So, in this series finale, I want to compare how some choices that apparently lower development costs actually increase costs elsewhere. I also want to highlight how, if we made different decisions during development, we could possibly expose those extra costs early on. This is beneficial because exposing costs upfront allows us to make tough choices when there is still a chance of changing course.</p><p>To make things specific, I will look at how the use of modern frameworks that facilitate development can end up hurting performance, reliability, and usability. So let&rsquo;s start with a three-part rant first (sorry) and then let&rsquo;s look at what we might do.</p></p><p class=text-muted>August 31, 2023

Today, I&rsquo;ll expore a different scenario to support the same idea. I&rsquo;m going to talk about how certain ticket assignment practices during on-call operations can expose service support costs vs. how other practices hide them.</p><p>Keep in mind that, just like in the previous post, I do not want to compare the general merits of one approach vs. the other. The <em>only</em> thing I want to compare is whether one approach centralizes toil and allows management to quantify its cost vs. how another approach hides toil by smearing it over the whole team in hard-to-quantify ways. Whether management <em>actually does something</em> to correct the situation once the costs are exposed is a different story.</p></p><p class=text-muted>August 26, 2023

Unfortunately, because such practices <em>feel</em> more expensive, teams choose to keep their status quo even when they know it is suboptimal. This choice ends up hurting productivity and morale because planned work is continuously interrupted, which in turn drags project completion.</p><p>The reason I say <em>seem</em> and not <em>are</em> is because the alternatives to these cost-exposing practices also suffer from costs. The difference is that, while the former surface costs, leading to the need to allocate time and people to infrastructure work, the latter keeps the costs smeared over teams and individuals in ways that are difficult to account and plan for.</p><p>To illustrate what I&rsquo;m trying to say, I&rsquo;ll present three different scenarios in which this opinion applies. All of these case studies come from past personal experiences while working in different teams and projects. The first one covered in this post is about the adoption of a monorepo vs. the use of multiple different repositories. The other two will come in follow-up articles.</p></p><p class=text-muted>August 23, 2023

This looked like a bunch of <tt>Arc<dyn foo></tt> objects passed around and was done to support extremely fast unit testing.</p><p>When I generalized the core logic of these services into the III-IV framework, I decided to experiment with a switch to static dispatch. The rationale was that using static dispatch better aligns with the design of well-regarded crates in the Rust ecosystem, and also because I wanted to avoid unnecessary runtime costs in the foundational pieces of my web services.</p><p>Let me tell you that this decision was a huge mistake and that the experiment has utterly failed. Using static dispatch has been a constant source of frustration due to the difficulty in passing types around and reasoning about trait bounds. The situation had gotten so bad that I dreaded adding new functionality to my services whenever a change to a statically-typed <tt>struct</tt> was needed, because that meant adding yet another type parameter and plumbing it through tens of source files.</p><p>In lieu of the difficulties, which eventually turned into blockers to implementing new features, I made the choice of going back to dynamic dispatch. The goal was to gain ergonomics at the expense of a supposedly-negligible runtime cost. Let me tell you about the problems I faced, the refactoring journey, and some measurements I gathered after the rewrite.</p></p><p class=text-muted>August 6, 2023

This has made formal releases irrelevant which is, in part, why 0.3 is so far behind 0.2. But&mldr; I do believe in formal releases so I&rsquo;m hoping to put some effort and make the web UI track releases instead and then use the &ldquo;push on green&rdquo; flow only for a preview site.</p></p><p class=text-muted>November 29, 2020

During this period, I&rsquo;ve written a non-trivial amount of Go code both inside and <a href=/2017/08/introducing-sandboxfs.html>outside Google</a>, but never found the chance to sit back and learn Rust.</p><p>This changed a month ago during my yearly family trip to Korea. This time around, I decided upfront that I would <em>not</em> work on any personal or work projects for the 2-week long vacation. Instead, I would focus all spare time in reading. And I would read <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/>&ldquo;The Rust Programming Language&rdquo;, second edition</a>. The plan worked: getting through the book took the two weeks and I barely wrote any code.</p></p><p class=text-muted>May 25, 2018

For example, for a Python script you would use <code>#! /usr/bin/env python</code>, and then the saying goes, the script would &ldquo;just work&rdquo; on any machine with Python installed.</p><p>The reason for this recommendation is that <code>/usr/bin/env python</code> will search the <code>PATH</code> for a program called <code>python</code> and execute the first one found&mldr; and that usually works fine <em>on one&rsquo;s own machine</em>.</p></p><p class=text-muted>September 14, 2016

Because it supports object-oriented capabilities and has powerful object libraries&mdash;such as the STL or Boost&mdash;one can quickly implement robust, high-level systems. On the other hand, thanks to its C roots, C++ allows the implementation of very low-level code. This has advantages but also carries some disadvantages, especially when one attempts to write high-level applications.</p></p><p class=text-muted>May 4, 2006

He eventually finds common problems in these projects, resulting in a complex packaging process and a final package that is a nightmare to maintain. These little flaws exist because in most cases the original developers are not packagers, so they are not aware of them. In other words, if you do not know something is wrong, you cannot fix it.</p></p><p class=text-muted>March 31, 2005
