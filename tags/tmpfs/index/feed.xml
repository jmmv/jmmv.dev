      <description>A bit more than a year ago, I reported that tmpfs was being ported to FreeBSD from NetBSD (remember that tmpfs was my Google SoC 2005 project and was integrated into NetBSD soon after the program ended). And Juan Romero Pardines has just brought to my attention that tmpfs is already part of FreeBSD-current! This is really cool :-)
The code was imported to FreeBSD-current on the 16th as seen in the commit mail, so I suppose it will be part of the next major version (7.</description>

However, several problems remained in it that prevented tagging it release quality (see this thread).
Finally I found some time to deal with most of them, something that has kept me busy for around three weeks (and which I should have done much, much earlier).</description>
