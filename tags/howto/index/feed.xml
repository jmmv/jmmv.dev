      <description>When I joined the NetBSD Board of Directors, I was trusted with access to private information and one of the prerequisites for downloading such data was to be able to store it safely: i.e. inside an encrypted volume. I initially went the easy route by putting the data in my laptop, which already uses FileVault 2 to encrypt the whole disk. But soon after, I decided that it would be nicer to put this data in my NetBSD home server, which is the machine that is perpetually connected to IRC and thus the one I use to log into the weekly meetings.</description>
