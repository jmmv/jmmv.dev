      <description>Welcome to my updated homepage, this time at its third major version!
First iteration &amp;mdash; a year ago The first iteration of this site, which went live exactly a year ago, was a single static page that leveraged Twitter&amp;rsquo;s Bootstrap. I created that page for two reasons: to serve as the target for all the &amp;ldquo;homepage&amp;rdquo; links that online profiles require, and to learn Bootstrap. Due to the site&amp;rsquo;s simplicity and goals, its contents were not very interesting nor dynamic.</description>

      <description>Back in May, I wanted to play a little bit with Twitter Bootstrap and the result of those experiments was that I set up a personal site on this same URL. The site served me well for these months, but I wanted to see it grow to better represent my presence on the Internet. To that end, I have now been playing with Jekyll, a static content management system natively supported by GitHub Pages, and came up with the site you are own now, which went live yesterday.</description>
