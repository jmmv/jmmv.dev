Rust is particularly well-suited at this task: its lack of implicit type conversions eliminates surprises, and its ownership semantics allow type transformations with zero cost.
Unfortunately, (ab)using narrow types in an app&rsquo;s domain is really annoying when writing tests. While non-test code rarely instantiates new objects&mdash;in the case of a REST service, this would only happen at the service&rsquo;s boundaries&mdash;tests instantiate objects infinitely more times than non-test code. Code patterns that may seem reasonable in non-test code can become unbearable in tests.
In this post, I want to look into the various ways in which you can instantiate strongly-typed objects. For each, I show examples and describe their pros and cons. And yes, as a matter of fact, I have tried them all before&mldr; and I can&rsquo;t yet make my mind as to which one is best.</p><p class=text-muted>October 6, 2023

When you force yourself to avoid modifying already-defined variables, you will need to find other ways to express your intent. To do so, in general: you will use a high-order construction instead of a loop; you will end up having to define intermediate variables, each with its own descriptive name; or you will move pieces of the code to an auxiliary function, also with a descriptive name.</p><p class=text-muted>July 25, 2013

In this article we will focus on the former kind.
One way to think of those conditionals is as if they were to represent functions, just written inline. In other words: while it should be possible to move the conditional statement to a separate function, it has not been done because the algorithm is simple enough to not warrant it.</p><p class=text-muted>July 22, 2013

if balance >= 0: color = BLACK else: color = RED In this little code snippet, the condition balance >= 0 only depends on one variable, and the two branches of the conditional cover all possible values of the input variable. I.e. the first branch covers all cases where the balance is positive or zero, and the second branch covers all cases where the balance is negative. The balance variable cannot have a value not covered by these cases. Easy.</p><p class=text-muted>July 18, 2013

No: a dictionary is not a way to implement abstract data types; doing so is lazy programming and is asking for trouble later on.
What do I mean by this? In Python and other similar dynamic languages, dictionaries are a mapping of keys to values that have no typing restrictions: the dictionary is heterogeneous, and a single dictionary can contain elements of different types both as its keys and its values. To make things worse, the syntax of the language makes it incredibly easy to create and populate dictionaries (unlike, say, in C++). Combine these two facts together and the temptation to abuse a dictionary to implement a structured data type is high.</p><p class=text-muted>July 4, 2013

These checks are usually only performed in debug builds, which means that you must ensure that the expressions in the assertions are side-effect free.
Because assertions are only validated in debug builds, you can abuse them to make your code more readable without impacting performance and without having to write a comment. Every time you write a line in which you assume a particular machine state that is not clearly implied by the code immediately preceding the new line, write an assertion.</p><p class=text-muted>July 1, 2013

Right. Except that the real goal is to have valuable comments only, and doing so is a (very) complex matter. The code should document itself at all times, and be crystal-clear at doing so. Redundant or useless comments hinder readability, if only because their presence denotes that the code is not clear enough to be self-descriptive, because they are obsolete, because they are confusing, or because they very frequently include typos or grammar mistakes.</p><p class=text-muted>June 27, 2013

The feedback so far has been positive and I owe all of you a follow-up post. However, writing such post will take a while and content must keep flowing. So let&rsquo;s get back to the readability series for now.
In dynamically-typed languages1, variable and function definitions do not state the type of their arguments. This is quite convenient when writing code, but results in very hard to read &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; later on. Consider this snippet:</p><p class=text-muted>June 24, 2013

As it turns out, code has prose in it most of the time in the form of comments and documentation.
So, when you write any text in your code, engrave this in mind: any obvious typos and/or any grammar mistake very quickly denote sloppiness in what you wrote. If that is the impression the reader gets from your comments&mldr; why would he trust that you have been less sloppy when writing the code itself?

All of us have, at some point, written calc_usage instead of calculate_usage; res instead of result; stmt instead of statement; ctx instead of context; etc. The thought goes &ldquo;well, these abbreviations are obvious, and I&rsquo;ll be a much faster developer!&rdquo;
Wrong. You might think you are faster at typing, but you don&rsquo;t write code in one go and never ever get back to it again. As we have already mentioned, code is usually only written once and is later read many times, possibly by people other than the original developer. At the very least, I&rsquo;d expect you going over your code once before checking it into your repository.

That&rsquo;s a pretty loose suggestion though, so let&rsquo;s look at some specific situations in which you want to consider your vertical spacing practices (both adding and removing).
Give some air to long functions Functions longer than a handful lines generally deserve some vertical spacing. A first guideline is to separate the return of the result value (along all of its boilerplate) from everything else that the function may be doing.</p><p class=text-muted>June 10, 2013

For example: in at least Python and the shell, it is the case that a variable defined anywhere within a function —even inside conditionals or loops— is reachable anywhere in the function from there on.
To illustrate what this means, consider this snippet in which we define a function to compute the CPU requirements needed in a database system to support a set of tables:</p><p class=text-muted>June 6, 2013

This post is the beginning of a new series on the idioms and style that I use to keep code readable and obvious. I often get positive comments when undergoing peer reviews at Google and externally, so I am going to share such personal style in the hope that it might be useful to some of you. Explaining these ideas to coworkers when I review their code has proven to be useful in the long term.</p><p class=text-muted>June 3, 2013
