Another month has passed so it&amp;rsquo;s time for a brief recap of the main news, articles, and projects that made the rounds during this period and are on topic for Blog System/5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As usual, this is not just a list: every entry is accompanied by a short blurb detailing why I found the content interesting, which is meant to nudge you into reading it! Also, the list is ordered by when the links made it my way, not chronologically, and some items are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> from this time period.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-02-29-links.jpg" length="243606" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: January 2024 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/01/links-january-2024-edition.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/01/links-january-2024-edition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>It is hard to believe but we are already one month into 2024. January has flown by for me and I haven&amp;rsquo;t done a good job at keeping up with news sites&amp;hellip; but I have been reading them on and off and I have collected a small set of interesting articles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To everyone new around here, hello and thanks for subscribing! For some context, what follows is my manual selection of cool articles, videos, and projects I stumbled upon during this time period. However, this is not just a dump of links: each link is accompanied by a short commentary to justifies why I thought the material was interesting, why it is relevant to this publication and, more importantly, an attempt to nudge you into reading the source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s get to it.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-31-links.png" length="56457" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: December 2023 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/links-december-2023-edition.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 09:40:00 +0100</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/links-december-2023-edition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>December draws to a close as does 2023, which means it&amp;rsquo;s time for yet another monthly links recap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For context to everyone new around here, what follows is my manual curation of cool articles, videos, and projects I stumbled upon during this time period. But this is not &lt;em>just&lt;/em> a dump of links: &lt;em>each link is accompanied by a short commentary&lt;/em> that justifies why I thought the material was interesting, why it is relevant to this publication and, more importantly, an attempt to nudge you into reading it.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-31-links.png" length="56457" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: November 2023 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/links-november-2023-edition.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2023 10:30:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/links-november-2023-edition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to the second edition of my &amp;ldquo;interesting links&amp;rdquo; recap, this time covering the month of November 2023.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For context, what follows is my manual curation of cool articles, videos, and projects I stumbled upon during this time period. But this is not &lt;em>just&lt;/em> a dump of links: &lt;em>each link is accompanied by a 1-paragraph commentary&lt;/em> that justifies why I thought the material was cool, why it is relevant to this publication and, more importantly, an attempt to nudge you into reading it.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-31-links.png" length="56457" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: October 2023 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/links-october-2023-edition.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 12:30:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/links-october-2023-edition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Inspired by the works of &lt;a href="https://eatonphil.com/">Phil Eaton&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ve been highlighting articles and projects that I find interesting in &lt;del>Twitter&lt;/del> X and Mastodon. Some of these posts were more &amp;ldquo;successful&amp;rdquo; than I had expected, which I take to mean that doing this is interesting to you all. So, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good idea to periodically collect them all in a post with a very brief commentary on each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a recap of the interesting articles that came my way in October 2023. This does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> mean that these articles were published during this period: some of them are older but I just (re)discovered them now. I&amp;rsquo;ll avoid referencing my own articles: you can find those by &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/archive.html">in the archive&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-31-links.png" length="56457" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
