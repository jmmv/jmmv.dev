&lt;p>I am probably not your average customer. If I send a support request to your team by email, it is because I have already exhausted all possible resources on my side and concluded, with good certainty, that there is an issue on your service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, I have read your online support material. I have tried different browsers. I have tried different devices and operating systems. I have tried disabling browser extensions. I have tried clearing cookies. I have looked at the Javascript console for errors&amp;mdash;which, by the way, your application is probably throwing even during normal operation; shrug. I have danced three times around the computer and clapped my hands.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
