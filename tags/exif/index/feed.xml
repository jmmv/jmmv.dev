We made a lot of photos there but, when we came back, we realized that most of us (not all!) forgot to adjust our camera's date to the foreign timezone, which was 5 hours behind of ours.
I imported all our photos in iPhoto but the difference in their timestamps made all images appear unsorted in the main view; this was very annoying.</description></item></channel></rss>
