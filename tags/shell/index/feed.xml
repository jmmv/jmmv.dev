      <title>test, [, and [[</title>

      <description>Did you know that Unix systems have a binary whose name is a single symbol?
Go and look for it. Run ls /bin/? and behold:
$ ls /bin/? /bin/[ Uh huh. [? The square bracket? That&amp;rsquo;s a program?!
But wait, it gets more interesting:
$ ls -li /bin/[ /bin/test 834 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root wheel 35824 Jan 23 08:59 /bin/[ 834 -rwxr-xr-x 1 root wheel 35824 Jan 23 08:59 /bin/test The two names, [ and test, point to the same binary1.</description>

      <title>The /bin/bash baggage of macOS</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2019/11/macos-bash-baggage.html</link>

      <description>As you may know, macOS ships with an ancient version of the Bash shell interpreter under /bin/bash. On an up-to-date Catalina installation, we get:
$ /bin/bash --version GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin19) Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. which is&amp;hellip; old. Bash 3.2.57 was released on November 7th, 2014&amp;mdash;five years ago. The most recent version is 5.0 from the beginning of this year&amp;mdash;so it&amp;rsquo;s not like nothing has changed since then.</description>

      <title>Shell readability: local</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/03/shell-readability-local.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/03/shell-readability-local.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As most programming languages with support for functions, the shell offers locally-scoped variables. Unfortunately, &lt;em&gt;local variables are not the default&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;You must explicitly declare variables as &lt;code&gt;local&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and you should &lt;strong&gt;be very strict about doing this&lt;/strong&gt; to prevent subtle but hard-to-diagnose bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it! What else is there to say about this trivial keyword? As it turns out, more than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shell readability: strict mode</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/03/shell-readability-strict-mode.html</link>

      <description>Some programming languages have a feature known as strict mode: a setting that makes the language interpreter disallow certain obviously-broken code that would otherwise work. The simplest examples are JavaScript and Perl but, as it turns out, the shell also has something akin to this feature. The &amp;ldquo;strict mode&amp;rdquo; name, however, is unofficial, so you won&amp;rsquo;t find many references to it online.
You can enable the shell&amp;rsquo;s strict mode by doing one of the following:</description>

      <title>Shell readability: function parameters</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/03/shell-readability-function-parameters.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/03/shell-readability-function-parameters.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The shell supports defining functions, which, &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmmv.dev/2018/02/shell-readability-main.html&#34;&gt;as we learned in the previous post&lt;/a&gt;, you should embrace and use. Unfortunately, they are fairly primitive and their use can, paradoxically, introduce other readability problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One specific problem is that &lt;strong&gt;function parameters are numbered, not named&lt;/strong&gt;, so the risk of cryptic code is high. Let&amp;rsquo;s see why this is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shell readability: main</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/02/shell-readability-main.html</link>

      <description>Our team develops Bazel, a Java-based tool. We do have, however, a significant amount of shell scripting. The percentage is small at only 3.6% of our codebase&amp;hellip; but given the size of our project, that&amp;rsquo;s about 130,000 linesâ€”a lot, really.
Pretty much nobody likes writing these integration tests in shell. Leaving aside that our infrastructure is clunky, the real problem is that the team at large is not familiar with writing shell per se.</description>

      <title>Introducing shtk</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2012/08/introducing-shtk.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2012/08/introducing-shtk.html</guid>
      <description>Have you ever wanted to have a collection of ready-to-use modules for shell scripts? I have, particularly because I keep reimplementing the same functions over and over and over and over again whenever I write non-trivial shell scripts, and I&#39;m tired of doing so.
That&#39;s why I have just abstracted all the common code in the aforementioned tools and put it into a new package called the &#34;Shell Toolkit&#34;, or shtk for short.</description>
