I have, particularly because I keep reimplementing the same functions over and over and over and over again whenever I write non-trivial shell scripts, and I'm tired of doing so.<br><br>That's why I have just abstracted all the common code in the aforementioned tools and <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-changes/2012/08/15/msg077072.html>put it into a new package called the "Shell Toolkit", or shtk for short</a>. Yeah, this name sounds very pretentious but, really, I don't intend this to be anything big. The only thing I want to do is simplify my life when implementing shell scripts, and hope that other people might find the modules useful. So far, I have taken the generic (and common!) code from sysbuild and sysupgrade, reconciled a few tiny divergences, and moved it into this new shtk package.<br><br class=Apple-interchange-newline>In reality, writing something like shtk is sin-borderline. I really should not be using shell scripting for the kind of tools I am implementing (they deserve better data structures and better error checking than what shell provides, for example). However, shell scripting is incredible convenient to get reasonably-good implementations of such tools with minimal effort, and is the only scripting language available in NetBSD's base system. (Yes, yes, there is Lua, but my limited knowledge of Lua would not let me write these tools in any decent manner nor in any reasonable time.)<br><div><br></div>So, what's in shtk? There are a few functions to deal with command lines (error/warning reporting and such things), some trivial stuff to deal with lists, a bunch of code to interact with cvs and, what I like the most, a module to implement configuration files with some kind of key/value validation.<br><br>At the moment, shtk can only be found in pkgsrc under <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/devel/shtk?only_with_tag=MAIN">pkgsrc/devel/shtk</a>&nbsp;and I don't currently have any plans to make it more widely available. If there are enough people interested in that with real needs, I could reconsider, but the maintenance effort would be non-trivial.<br><br>To showcase the features of shtk, I have updated the sysbuild and sysupgrade packages to depend on this new toolkit while at the same time dropping all this duplicate supporting code. It's a good thing that I wrote exhaustive tests for all possible code paths, because the migration from the built-in modules to shtk was riddled with subtleties that would have impacted end users otherwise.<br><br>Now... time to really consider taking the task of rewriting pkg_comp in a more&nbsp;maintainable&nbsp;style so that I can add the features I have wished for for many years (like OS X support).</p><p class=text-muted>August 15, 2012

But what fun is that if you have no trivial way of upgrading your existing NetBSD installation to a newer version?<br><br>Upgrading NetBSD to a newer version from distribution sets generally looks like the following;<br><ol><li>Fetch new distribution sets (or roll your own).</li><li>Upgrade the kernel.</li><li>Unpack the distribution sets over the root directory, without fat-fingering the command and unpacking <tt>etc.tgz</tt> along the way.</li><li>Use <tt>etcupdate</tt> to merge new changes to configuration files.</li><li>Use <tt>postinstall</tt> to validate the upgraded system.</li></ol><b>Simple? Yes. Easy? No.</b> The above procedure is obscure to anyone new to NetBSD. (Actually, if you tell anybody that the way to upgrade your machine is by unpacking tarballs over <tt>/</tt> will stare at you thinking you are kidding. It's 2012.) "Jokes" aside, what is worse is that the procedure is quite monotonous and, therefore, it is very easy for the administrator to make a trivial mistake along the way and screw up a running system. (Been there, done that... multiple times.)<br><br>Machines are made to automate trivial and repetitive tasks like the above, and they are actually very good at that. Over the years, I have performed NetBSD updates manually and later written crappy, unreliable scripts to do the upgrades for me. These scripts have never been reusable and they haven't dealt with error conditions gracefully. Furthermore, because these scripts live in my home directory, I have to remember to carry them around every time I set up a new NetBSD box.<br><br>It was about time I sat down and rewrote my custom scripts into something more "decent". Something with documentation, with a configuration file, and with tests.<br><br>So today, and for all the reason above, I am <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-changes/2012/08/06/msg076544.html>introducing sysupgrade</a>.<br><br>sysupgrade is a script that automates (trivializes) the whole process of upgrading an existing NetBSD installation to a newer release,&nbsp;be it the currently-running system or a non-live system. sysupgrade does so by following the steps outlined above and is coordinated by a configuration file. You can find the tool in <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/sysutils/sysupgrade/?only_with_tag=MAIN"><span id=goog_1890316919></span>pkgsrc/sysutils/sysupgrade<span id=goog_1890316920></span></a>, next to sysbuild. The bundled <tt>sysupgrade(8)</tt> and <tt>sysupgrade.conf(5)</tt> manual pages, and the default <tt>sysupgrade.conf</tt> configuration file should get you started and hopefully answer most of your questions.<br><br>For the impatient, the following command would upgrade your machine to the specified version target:<br><br><tt>$ sysupgrade auto</tt><br><tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-&lt;X.Y.Z>/$(uname -m)</tt><br><br>At the moment, please consider sysupgrade to be experimental. It works well for me on my various machines (running both NetBSD 6.0 BETA and -current), and I have been using the upgrade procedure outlined above for years without issues. However, as with any shiny-new software, be careful. If you use NetBSD on a virtual machine, take a snapshot before running this tool; I don't think your machine is going to blow up, but better safe than sorry!<br><br>Enjoy, and feedback very welcome!<br><br>PS: There is lots of room for improvement. The <tt>TODO</tt> file in the package directory includes some of the ideas I'd like to work on later.</p><p class=text-muted>August 6, 2012

The way I work is the following:</div><div><span style=background-color:#fff><br></span></div><div><span style=background-color:#fff>I keep a read-write copy of the sources under my home directory, which is the one I use for my development work.

The thought of having to set up this whole scheme all over again, <i>by hand</i>, is what triggered the creation of <tt>sysbuild</tt>.</div><div><br></div><h2>Getting started</h2><div><tt>sysbuild</tt> lives in pkgsrc under the <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/sysutils/sysbuild/?only_with_tag=MAIN">pkgsrc/sysutils/sysbuild</a> directory.

Simply typing <tt>sysbuild build</tt> from anywhere in the system will cause the source tree to be updated and a release for your current platform to be built.</div><div><br></div><div>If you wish to customize the behavior of <tt>sysbuild</tt>, copy <tt>/usr/pkg/etc/sysbuild/default.conf</tt> to <tt>~/.sysbuild/default.conf</tt> and edit the latter.

These wrappers make intensive use of RAII to prevent resource leakage, expose C++-friendly data types, report errors by means of exceptions and ensure that the Lua stack is always left untouched in the face of errors. The library also provides a small subset of miscellaneous utility functions built on top of the wrappers.<br><br>Lutok focuses on providing a clean and safe C++ interface; the drawback is that it is not suitable for performance-critical environments. In order to implement error-safe C++ wrappers on top of a Lua C binary library, Lutok adds several layers or abstraction and error checking that go against the original spirit of the Lua C API and thus degrade performance.<br><br>Lutok was originally developed within Kyua but was later split into its own project to make it available to general developers.</blockquote>Coming up with a name for this project was quite an odyssey, and is what has delayed is release more than I wanted. My original candidate was "luawrap" which, although not very original, was to-the-point and easy to understand. Unfortunately, that name did not clear with the legal department and I had to propose several other names, some of which were not acceptable either. Eventually, I settled with "Lutok", which comes from "LUa TOolKit".<br><br>At this point, the source tree of Lutok provides pretty much the same code as the <tt>utils::lua</tt> module of Kyua. While it may be enough to get you started, I'm pretty sure you will lack some functions in the <tt>state</tt> class. If that is the case, don't hesitate to file a bug report to let me know what is missing.<br><br>In case you missed the link above, the project page is here: <a href=http://code.google.com/p/lutok/>Lutok in Google Code</a>.</p><p class=text-muted>September 15, 2011
