As I type this, I&amp;rsquo;m on my way back home from the conference in Brussels. And it has been nice. In the end. I must confess I was frustrated by the middle of the first day, though things got better after that.
Here is the thing: FOSDEM is not your usual conference. There are lots of things going on at once and all of them are crowded.</description></item><item><title>BSDCan 2014 summary</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2014/05/bsdcan-2014-summary.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2014 18:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2014/05/bsdcan-2014-summary.html</guid><description>BSDCan 2014 and the accompanying FreeBSD devsummit are officially over. Let's recap.
FreeBSD devsummit
The FreeBSD devsumit at BSDCan is, by far, the largest of them all. It is true that I already visited a devsummit once —the one in EuroBSDCon 2013—, but this is the first time I participate in the "real deal" while also being a committer.
The first impressive thing about this devsummit is that there were about 120 attendees.</description></item><item><title>FreeBSD Test Suite tutorial at AsiaBSDCon 2014</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2014/01/freebsd-test-suite-tutorial-at.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2014 07:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2014/01/freebsd-test-suite-tutorial-at.html</guid><description>I am pleased to announce that the tutorial on the FreeBSD Test Suite that I proposed for AsiaBSDCon 2014 has been accepted!
The conference website will soon include more details, but allow me to spoil your wait:
Goals: Learn how to use the test suite, how it is internally organized and how new tests can be written. Stretch goal: Get attendees to contribute one or more tests to the project.</description></item><item><title>Live from EuroBSDCon 2013, day 4</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-4.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2013 14:16:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-4.html</guid><description>Live from Malta today attending the EuroBSDCon 2013 conference. The conference is over; today was the second and last day and it has just finished.
Hardware and virtualization
One of the three tracks today included a lot of talks on hardware, porting of BSDs to new hardware and virtualization techniques. Of all these, the few talks I attended covered the topics in great detail and proved to be very interesting.</description></item><item><title>Live from EuroBSDCon 2013, day 3</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-3.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2013 12:28:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-3.html</guid><description>Live from Malta today attending the EuroBSDCon 2013 conference. Today is the first day of the conference itself. Many more people have shown up as expected and there have been tons of very interesting talks all the time. It is both good and bad that there are several tracks: you can select the topic you are most interested in, but sometimes great talks overlap!
Keynote
Today's opening session was led by Theo de Raadt, the founder of OpenBSD.</description></item><item><title>Live from EuroBSDCon 2013, day 2</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-2.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2013 10:56:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-2.html</guid><description>Live from Malta today attending the EuroBSDCon 2013 conference. Today is the second day of tutorials, still overlapped by the second day of the FreeBSD devsummit and the only day of the NetBSD devsummit.
OpenBSD
Hallway conversations are powerful and, in my opinion, the best aspect of these conferences.
I had the chance today to talk to Peter Hessler from OpenBSD. Only 15 to 20 minutes of discussion were necessary to learn a lot about how the OpenBSD project is run and to clear some of the misconceptions I had, which I don't know where I got from.</description></item><item><title>Live from EuroBSDCon 2013, day 1</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-1.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2013 12:05:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/09/live-from-eurobsdcon-2013-day-1.html</guid><description>Hello everyone! Live from Malta today attending the EuroBSDCon 2013 conference.
Today is the first day out of four: two days of tutorials and two days of actual conference. The tutorials are overlapped by two days of the usual FreeBSD Developer Summit (devsummit for short) and one day of the infrequent NetBSD Developer Summit.
The ambient here is pretty good already: lots of enthusiastic people catching up since the last time they met each other and, more importantly, discussing ongoing developments.</description></item><item><title>Kyua: Weekly status report, BSDCan 2011 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2011/05/kyua-weekly-status-report-bsdcan-2011.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2011 16:07:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2011/05/kyua-weekly-status-report-bsdcan-2011.html</guid><description>I spent past week in Ottawa, Canada, attending the BSDCan 2011 conference. The conference was composed of lots of interesting content and hosted many influential and insightful BSD developers. While the NetBSD presence was very reduced, I could have some valuable talks with both NetBSD and FreeBSD developers.
Anyway. As part of BSDCan 2011, I gave a talk titled "Automated testing in NetBSD: past, present and future". The talk focused on explaining what led to the development of ATF in the context of NetBSD, what related technologies exist in NetBSD (rump, anita&amp;nbsp;and dashboards), what ATF's shortcomings are and how Kyua plans to resolve them.</description></item><item><title>NetBSD talk at Isla Cristina</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/04/netbsd-talk-at-isla-cristina.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2008 17:02:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/04/netbsd-talk-at-isla-cristina.html</guid><description>Yesterday night, I got back from the "I Jornadas Tecnológicas Isla Cristina", a small technological conference organized at Isla Cristina, a little town in Huelva, Spain.
The main organizers were the teachers of a local technical school (the IES Padre José Miravent), and they invited me to give a talk about NetBSD development. I will publish the slides soon, but I have to warn you that you will not like the source format, aka PowerPoint.</description></item></channel></rss>
