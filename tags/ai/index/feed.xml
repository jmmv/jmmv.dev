&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I&amp;rsquo;ve been grumpy about the new AI-based coding trend. I&amp;rsquo;ve been grumpy about the &amp;ldquo;push from above to use AI or else&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been grumpy about the eye-rolling hype I see on LinkedIn. I&amp;rsquo;ve been grumpy about being on the receiving end of vibe-coded PRs that over-engineer solutions to simple problems. I&amp;rsquo;ve been grumpy about the thought that we are about to see an amount of bloat like we have never imagined before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, at the same time, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using LLMs to review my articles, to perform deep research, to generate cover pictures, and before last week, I had even dipped my toes into AI-based coding agents to help me with boring, repetitive tasks. And you know what? I see their promise of increased productivity, yet the amounts of slop I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed make me skeptical and I have had little experience with coding agents myself to judge their promised usefulness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; surprise! Last weekend I decided to start a Claude Code subscription and, after spending a week on it, I am uncomfortably excited to use it more. How has this happened?
