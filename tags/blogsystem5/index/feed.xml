And because your project is of moderate size, it almost-certainly builds one or more binaries, at least one of which is a CLI tool. But let&amp;rsquo;s face it: you don&amp;rsquo;t have end-to-end testing for those tools, do you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em>sure&lt;/em> you have split the binary&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>main&lt;/code> function into its own file so that the rest of the tool can be put in a library, and I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em>extra-sure&lt;/em> that you have unit tests for such library. But&amp;hellip; those tests do little to verify the functionality and quality of the tool &lt;em>as experienced by the end user&lt;/em>. Consider: What exactly does the tool print to the console on success? Does it show errors nicely when they happen, or does it dump internal stack traces? How does it handle unknown flags or bad arguments? Is the built-in help message nicely rendered when your terminal is really wide? What if the terminal is narrow?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You must write end-to-end tests for your tools but, usually, that isn’t easy to do. Until today. Combining shtk with Bazel via the new &lt;code>rules_shtk&lt;/code> ruleset makes it trivial to write tests that verify the behavior of your CLI tools&amp;mdash;no matter what language they are written in&amp;mdash;and in this article I’m going to show you how.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-11-04-bazel-clamp.jpg" length="572746" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: October 2023 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/links-october-2023-edition.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 12:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/links-october-2023-edition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Inspired by the works of &lt;a href="https://eatonphil.com/">Phil Eaton&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ve been highlighting articles and projects that I find interesting in &lt;del>Twitter&lt;/del> X and Mastodon. Some of these posts were more &amp;ldquo;successful&amp;rdquo; than I had expected, which I take to mean that doing this is interesting to you all. So, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good idea to periodically collect them all in a post with a very brief commentary on each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a recap of the interesting articles that came my way in October 2023. This does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> mean that these articles were published during this period: some of them are older but I just (re)discovered them now. I&amp;rsquo;ll avoid referencing my own articles: you can find those by &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/archive.html">in the archive&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-31-links.png" length="56457" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>BazelCon 2023 et al. trip report</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/bazelcon-2023-et-al-trip-report.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 03:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/bazelcon-2023-et-al-trip-report.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted. I just came back to Seattle from a 10-day trip in which I attended three different Bazel events: the Build Meetup in Reykjavik, the Bazel Community Day in Munich, and BazelCon 2023 in Munich too. Oh, and because I was on the other side of the world, I also paid a visit to my family in Spain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attending these events has been incredibly useful and productive: I got exposure to many ideas and discussions that would just not happen online, I got to build connections with very interesting people and, of course, it has also been super fun too to reconnect with old coworkers and friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article contains the summary of the things I learned and the things I want to follow up on. These are just a bunch of cleaned-up notes which I took and are in the context of &lt;em>my&lt;/em> work with &lt;a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel&lt;/a> at &lt;a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake&lt;/a> and &lt;em>my&lt;/em> interests on build tools, so this is not endorsed by Snowflake.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-30-bazelcon.jpg" length="663230" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Hello, Blog System/5!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/hello-blog-system5.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 16:14:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/hello-blog-system5.html</guid><description>Blog System/5 is my new Substack publication in which I write about the variety of software and systems engineering topics that pique my interest. If that sounds too generic to you, it&amp;rsquo;s because it is: there are too many cool things to write about! And yes, this sounds exactly the same as this blog. Read on to understand the motivation behind the new publication and &lt;em>subscribe now&lt;/em> to not miss a beat!</description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-28-blog-system5-logo.png" length="76109" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
