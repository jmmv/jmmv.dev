Some of these posts were more &amp;ldquo;successful&amp;rdquo; than I had expected, which I take to mean that doing this is interesting to you all. So, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good idea to periodically collect them all in a post with a very brief commentary on each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a recap of the interesting articles that came my way in October 2023. This does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> mean that these articles were published during this period: some of them are older but I just (re)discovered them now. I&amp;rsquo;ll avoid referencing my own articles: you can find those by &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/archive.html">in the archive&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-31-links.png" length="56457" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>BazelCon 2023 et al. trip report</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/bazelcon-2023-et-al-trip-report.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 03:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/bazelcon-2023-et-al-trip-report.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted. I just came back to Seattle from a 10-day trip in which I attended three different Bazel events: the Build Meetup in Reykjavik, the Bazel Community Day in Munich, and BazelCon 2023 in Munich too. Oh, and because I was on the other side of the world, I also paid a visit to my family in Spain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attending these events has been incredibly useful and productive: I got exposure to many ideas and discussions that would just not happen online, I got to build connections with very interesting people and, of course, it has also been super fun too to reconnect with old coworkers and friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article contains the summary of the things I learned and the things I want to follow up on. These are just a bunch of cleaned-up notes which I took and are in the context of &lt;em>my&lt;/em> work with &lt;a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel&lt;/a> at &lt;a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake&lt;/a> and &lt;em>my&lt;/em> interests on build tools, so this is not endorsed by Snowflake.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-30-bazelcon.jpg" length="663230" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Hello, Blog System/5!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/hello-blog-system5.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 16:14:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/hello-blog-system5.html</guid><description>Blog System/5 is my new Substack publication in which I write about the variety of software and systems engineering topics that pique my interest.
