January has flown by for me and I haven&amp;rsquo;t done a good job at keeping up with news sites&amp;hellip; but I have been reading them on and off and I have collected a small set of interesting articles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To everyone new around here, hello and thanks for subscribing! For some context, what follows is my manual selection of cool articles, videos, and projects I stumbled upon during this time period. However, this is not just a dump of links: each link is accompanied by a short commentary to justifies why I thought the material was interesting, why it is relevant to this publication and, more importantly, an attempt to nudge you into reading the source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s get to it.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-31-links.png" length="56457" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>From 0 to 1 MB in DOS</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/01/from-0-to-1-mb-in-dos.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2024 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/01/from-0-to-1-mb-in-dos.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Since the last article on &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/the-ides-we-had-30-years-ago.html">the text-based IDEs of old&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write about the GCC port to DOS, namely &lt;a href="https://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">DJGPP&lt;/a>. As I worked on the draft for that topic, I realized that there is a ton of ground to cover to set the stage so I took most of the content on memory management out and wrote this separate post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article is a deep dive on how DOS had to pull out tricks to maximize the use of the very limited 1 MB address space of the 8086. Those tricks could exist because of the features later introduced by the 80286 and the 80386, but these were just clutches to paper over the fact that DOS could not leverage the real improvements provided by protected mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This detour is long but I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy it as much as I enjoyed researching the topic. I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the changes in the x86 architecture over time, starting with the 8086 and ending in the 80386, and how DOS kept up along the way. I&amp;rsquo;ll conclude with a peek into DOS&amp;rsquo; own &lt;tt>MEM&lt;/tt> and MemMaker utilities. I must omit details to keep the text manageable in size though, so please excuse the lack of detail in some areas; just follow the links to external documentation to learn more.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-01-17-8086-dos.jpg" length="220943" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: December 2023 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/links-december-2023-edition.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 09:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/links-december-2023-edition.html</guid><description>December draws to a close as does 2023, which means it&amp;rsquo;s time for yet another monthly links recap.
For context to everyone new around here, what follows is my manual curation of cool articles, videos, and projects I stumbled upon during this time period. But this is not just a dump of links: each link is accompanied by a short commentary that justifies why I thought the material was interesting, why it is relevant to this publication and, more importantly, an attempt to nudge you into reading it.</description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-31-links.png" length="56457" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>The IDEs we had 30 years ago... and we lost</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/the-ides-we-had-30-years-ago.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2023 10:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/the-ides-we-had-30-years-ago.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I grew up learning to program in the late 1980s / early 1990s. Back then, I did not fully comprehend what I was doing and why the tools I used were impressive given the constraints of the hardware we had. Having gained more knowledge throughout the years, it is now really fun to pick up DOSBox to re-experience those programs and compare them with our current state of affairs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, I want to look at the pure text-based IDEs that we had in that era before Windows eclipsed the PC industry. I want to do this because those IDEs had little to envy from the IDEs of today&amp;mdash;yet it feels as if we went through a dark era where we lost most of those features for years and they are only resurfacing now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If anything, stay for a nostalgic ride back in time and a little rant on &amp;ldquo;bloat&amp;rdquo;. But, more importantly, read on to gain perspective on what existed before so that you can evaluate future feature launches more critically.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bazel interview at Software Engineering Daily</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/bazel-interview-at-software-engineering.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 09:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/bazel-interview-at-software-engineering.html</guid><description>Just a bit over 2 months ago, on October 5th, 2023, Jordi Mon Companys interviewed me about Bazel for an episode in the Software Engineering Daily podcast.

Advice for new C programmers: &amp;ldquo;Avoid null-terminated strings; they&amp;rsquo;re outdated, inefficient and impractical.&amp;rdquo;
Create your own type with basic functions. It&amp;rsquo;s not that hard, and it goes a long way. One of the benefits of this approach, among others, is slicing without copying.
This suggestion has its merits and I understand where it is coming from: performance. You see: the traditional way to represent strings in C is to use NUL-terminated byte arrays.</description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-12-03-threads.jpg" length="588993" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: November 2023 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/links-november-2023-edition.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2023 10:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/links-november-2023-edition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Welcome to the second edition of my &amp;ldquo;interesting links&amp;rdquo; recap, this time covering the month of November 2023.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For context, what follows is my manual curation of cool articles, videos, and projects I stumbled upon during this time period. But this is not &lt;em>just&lt;/em> a dump of links: &lt;em>each link is accompanied by a 1-paragraph commentary&lt;/em> that justifies why I thought the material was cool, why it is relevant to this publication and, more importantly, an attempt to nudge you into reading it.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-31-links.png" length="56457" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>SSH agent forwarding and tmux done right</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/ssh-agent-forwarding-and-tmux-done.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 08:50:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/ssh-agent-forwarding-and-tmux-done.html</guid><description>The SSH agent is a little daemon that holds your private keys in memory. This is particularly handy when your keys are protected by a passphrase: you can unlock and add your keys to the agent once and, from then on, any SSH client such as ssh(1) can interact with the keys without asking you for the passphrase again.
The SSH agent becomes even handier when you primarily work on a remote workstation over SSH.</description></item><item><title>Why do I know shell, and how can you?</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/why-do-i-know-shell-and-how-can-you.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Nov 2023 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/why-do-i-know-shell-and-how-can-you.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Why do you know so much shell?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> is a question I&amp;rsquo;m getting a lot at work lately. So yeah, why? And how can you learn it too? There is no secret here: I know the shell well because I was &amp;ldquo;forced&amp;rdquo; to write tools in it for a while and, because of that, I made a conscious effort to learn the language and get better at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You see, most people that write shell don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with it. They stitch together whatever works into a script and call it a day, making a bunch of spaghetti even if it goes against the coding best practices they already know. And when they encounter some odd syntax they don&amp;rsquo;t recognize, their reaction is to say &amp;ldquo;this has to be rewritten in Python!&amp;rdquo; instead of taking a breath and trying to really understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that plenty of senior engineers scoff at shell scripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it is true: the shell is arcane and has many flaws as a programming language. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to convince you to start writing new tools in it. But the shell is also an incredible rapid prototyping language, and you can use it to solve business problems really quickly and with surprisingly little code. If you pause for a second to learn it, you&amp;rsquo;ll realize that you can bend tradition and write maintainable shell code too. Hear out how I got into writing so much shell and how you can get better at it too.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-11-10-sh-manpage.jpg" length="425378" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>End-to-end tool testing with Bazel and shtk</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/end-to-end-tool-testing-with-bazel.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 07:50:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/end-to-end-tool-testing-with-bazel.html</guid><description>&lt;p>If you use Bazel, your project is of moderate size. And because your project is of moderate size, it almost-certainly builds one or more binaries, at least one of which is a CLI tool. But let&amp;rsquo;s face it: you don&amp;rsquo;t have end-to-end testing for those tools, do you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em>sure&lt;/em> you have split the binary&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>main&lt;/code> function into its own file so that the rest of the tool can be put in a library, and I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em>extra-sure&lt;/em> that you have unit tests for such library. But&amp;hellip; those tests do little to verify the functionality and quality of the tool &lt;em>as experienced by the end user&lt;/em>. Consider: What exactly does the tool print to the console on success? Does it show errors nicely when they happen, or does it dump internal stack traces? How does it handle unknown flags or bad arguments? Is the built-in help message nicely rendered when your terminal is really wide? What if the terminal is narrow?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You must write end-to-end tests for your tools but, usually, that isn‚Äôt easy to do. Until today. Combining shtk with Bazel via the new &lt;code>rules_shtk&lt;/code> ruleset makes it trivial to write tests that verify the behavior of your CLI tools&amp;mdash;no matter what language they are written in&amp;mdash;and in this article I‚Äôm going to show you how.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-11-04-bazel-clamp.jpg" length="572746" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: October 2023 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/links-october-2023-edition.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 12:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/links-october-2023-edition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Inspired by the works of &lt;a href="https://eatonphil.com/">Phil Eaton&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ve been highlighting articles and projects that I find interesting in &lt;del>Twitter&lt;/del> X and Mastodon. Some of these posts were more &amp;ldquo;successful&amp;rdquo; than I had expected, which I take to mean that doing this is interesting to you all. So, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good idea to periodically collect them all in a post with a very brief commentary on each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a recap of the interesting articles that came my way in October 2023. This does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> mean that these articles were published during this period: some of them are older but I just (re)discovered them now. I&amp;rsquo;ll avoid referencing my own articles: you can find those by &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/archive.html">in the archive&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-31-links.png" length="56457" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>BazelCon 2023 et al. trip report</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/bazelcon-2023-et-al-trip-report.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Oct 2023 03:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/bazelcon-2023-et-al-trip-report.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted. I just came back to Seattle from a 10-day trip in which I attended three different Bazel events: the Build Meetup in Reykjavik, the Bazel Community Day in Munich, and BazelCon 2023 in Munich too. Oh, and because I was on the other side of the world, I also paid a visit to my family in Spain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attending these events has been incredibly useful and productive: I got exposure to many ideas and discussions that would just not happen online, I got to build connections with very interesting people and, of course, it has also been super fun too to reconnect with old coworkers and friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article contains the summary of the things I learned and the things I want to follow up on. These are just a bunch of cleaned-up notes which I took and are in the context of &lt;em>my&lt;/em> work with &lt;a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel&lt;/a> at &lt;a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake&lt;/a> and &lt;em>my&lt;/em> interests on build tools, so this is not endorsed by Snowflake.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-30-bazelcon.jpg" length="662944" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Hello, Blog System/5!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/hello-blog-system5.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2023 16:14:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/10/hello-blog-system5.html</guid><description>Blog System/5 is my new Substack publication in which I write about the variety of software and systems engineering topics that pique my interest.
