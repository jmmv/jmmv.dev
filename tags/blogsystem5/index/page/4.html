I really, really do, and I agree with the premise that memory-unsafe languages like C++ should not be used anymore. But claiming that Rust would have prevented the massive outage that the world went through last Friday is misleading and actively harmful to Rust&rsquo;s evangelism.
Having CrowdStrike written in Rust would have minimized the chances of the outage happening, but not resolved the root cause that allowed the outage to happen in the first place. Thus, it irks me to see various folks blanket-claiming that Rust is the answer. It&rsquo;s not, and pushing this agenda hurts Rust&rsquo;s adoption more than it helps: C++ experts can understand the root cause and see that this claim is misleading, causing further divide in the systems programming world.
So, why won&rsquo;t Rust help? Let me try to answer that question, but while we are at it, let&rsquo;s also delve deeper into the causes of the outage. In a way, let me put my SRE hat on and write my own version of the postmortem.</p><p class=text-muted>July 23, 2024

You obviously can be one, but there is some nuance in what &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; C is truly about. Here is my take on the matter.
Let me repeat this first: of course you can be a perfectly good programmer without knowing C. Knowing a language doesn&rsquo;t make or break a programmer, and there are great programmers out there that don&rsquo;t touch C.</p><p class=text-muted>February 21, 2024

I remember using DJGPP back in the 1990s before I had been exposed to Linux and feeling that it was a strange beast. Compared to the Microsoft C Compiler and Turbo C++, the tooling was bloated and alien to DOS, and the resulting binaries were huge. But DJGPP provided a complete development environment for free, which I got from a monthly magazine, and I could even look at its source code if I wished. You can&rsquo;t imagine what a big deal that was at the time.
But even if I could look under the cover, I never did. I never really understood why was DJGPP so strange, slow, and huge, or why it even existed. Until now. As I&rsquo;m in the mood of looking back, I&rsquo;ve spent the last couple of months figuring out what the foundations of this software were and how it actually worked. Part of this research has resulted in the previous two posts on DOS memory management. And part of this research is this article. Let&rsquo;s take a look!</p><p class=text-muted>February 14, 2024

I know I promised that this follow-up article would be about DJGPP, but before getting into that review, I realized I had to take another detour to cover three more topics. Namely: unreal mode, which I intentionally ignored to not derail the post; LOADALL, which I didn&rsquo;t know about until you readers mentioned it; and DOS extenders, which I was planning to describe in the DJGPP article but they are a better fit for this one.
So&mldr; strap your seat belts on and dive right in for another tour through the ancient techniques that DOS had to pull off to peek into the memory address space above the first MB. And get your hands ready because we&rsquo;ll go over assembly code for a step-by-step jump into unreal mode.</p><p class=text-muted>February 7, 2024

As I worked on the draft for that topic, I realized that there is a ton of ground to cover to set the stage so I took most of the content on memory management out and wrote this separate post.
This article is a deep dive on how DOS had to pull out tricks to maximize the use of the very limited 1 MB address space of the 8086. Those tricks could exist because of the features later introduced by the 80286 and the 80386, but these were just clutches to paper over the fact that DOS could not leverage the real improvements provided by protected mode.
This detour is long but I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy it as much as I enjoyed researching the topic. I&rsquo;ll walk you through the changes in the x86 architecture over time, starting with the 8086 and ending in the 80386, and how DOS kept up along the way. I&rsquo;ll conclude with a peek into DOS&rsquo; own MEM and MemMaker utilities. I must omit details to keep the text manageable in size though, so please excuse the lack of detail in some areas; just follow the links to external documentation to learn more.</p><p class=text-muted>January 17, 2024

Back then, I did not fully comprehend what I was doing and why the tools I used were impressive given the constraints of the hardware we had. Having gained more knowledge throughout the years, it is now really fun to pick up DOSBox to re-experience those programs and compare them with our current state of affairs.
This time around, I want to look at the pure text-based IDEs that we had in that era before Windows eclipsed the PC industry. I want to do this because those IDEs had little to envy from the IDEs of today&mdash;yet it feels as if we went through a dark era where we lost most of those features for years and they are only resurfacing now.
If anything, stay for a nostalgic ride back in time and a little rant on &ldquo;bloat&rdquo;. But, more importantly, read on to gain perspective on what existed before so that you can evaluate future feature launches more critically.</p><p class=text-muted>December 25, 2023

Create your own type with basic functions. It&rsquo;s not that hard, and it goes a long way. One of the benefits of this approach, among others, is slicing without copying.
This suggestion has its merits and I understand where it is coming from: performance. You see: the traditional way to represent strings in C is to use NUL-terminated byte arrays.</p><p class=text-muted>December 3, 2023

The SSH agent becomes even handier when you primarily work on a remote workstation over SSH.</p><p class=text-muted>November 17, 2023

So yeah, why? And how can you learn it too? There is no secret here: I know the shell well because I was &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to write tools in it for a while and, because of that, I made a conscious effort to learn the language and get better at it.
You see, most people that write shell don&rsquo;t want to deal with it. They stitch together whatever works into a script and call it a day, making a bunch of spaghetti even if it goes against the coding best practices they already know. And when they encounter some odd syntax they don&rsquo;t recognize, their reaction is to say &ldquo;this has to be rewritten in Python!&rdquo; instead of taking a breath and trying to really understand what&rsquo;s going on. It doesn&rsquo;t help that plenty of senior engineers scoff at shell scripts.
And it is true: the shell is arcane and has many flaws as a programming language. I don&rsquo;t want to convince you to start writing new tools in it. But the shell is also an incredible rapid prototyping language, and you can use it to solve business problems really quickly and with surprisingly little code. If you pause for a second to learn it, you&rsquo;ll realize that you can bend tradition and write maintainable shell code too. Hear out how I got into writing so much shell and how you can get better at it too.</p><p class=text-muted>November 10, 2023

I&rsquo;m sure you have split the binary&rsquo;s main function into its own file so that the rest of the tool can be put in a library, and I&rsquo;m extra-sure that you have unit tests for such library. But&mldr; those tests do little to verify the functionality and quality of the tool as experienced by the end user. Consider: What exactly does the tool print to the console on success? Does it show errors nicely when they happen, or does it dump internal stack traces? How does it handle unknown flags or bad arguments? Is the built-in help message nicely rendered when your terminal is really wide? What if the terminal is narrow?
You must write end-to-end tests for your tools but, usually, that isn’t easy to do. Until today. Combining shtk with Bazel via the new rules_shtk ruleset makes it trivial to write tests that verify the behavior of your CLI tools&mdash;no matter what language they are written in&mdash;and in this article I’m going to show you how.</p><p class=text-muted>November 4, 2023

Some of these posts were more &ldquo;successful&rdquo; than I had expected, which I take to mean that doing this is interesting to you all. So, it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to periodically collect them all in a post with a very brief commentary on each.
Here is a recap of the interesting articles that came my way in October 2023. This does not mean that these articles were published during this period: some of them are older but I just (re)discovered them now. I&rsquo;ll avoid referencing my own articles: you can find those by in the archive.</p><p class=text-muted>October 31, 2023

I just came back to Seattle from a 10-day trip in which I attended three different Bazel events: the Build Meetup in Reykjavik, the Bazel Community Day in Munich, and BazelCon 2023 in Munich too. Oh, and because I was on the other side of the world, I also paid a visit to my family in Spain.
Attending these events has been incredibly useful and productive: I got exposure to many ideas and discussions that would just not happen online, I got to build connections with very interesting people and, of course, it has also been super fun too to reconnect with old coworkers and friends.
This article contains the summary of the things I learned and the things I want to follow up on. These are just a bunch of cleaned-up notes which I took and are in the context of my work with Bazel at Snowflake and my interests on build tools, so this is not endorsed by Snowflake.</p><p class=text-muted>October 30, 2023
