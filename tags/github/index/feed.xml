      <description>For a couple of years or so, I have been hosting my open source projects in Google Code. The time to jump ship has come.
The major reason for this move is that Google Code stopped supporting file downloads three weeks ago. This is unfortunate given that &#34;binary&#34; releases are a must for proper software distribution. Sure, I could use a third-party service like Bintray to offer the downloads, but I&#39;d rather consolidate all project data in a single location.</description>

      <description>Over a year ago, I developed two command line utilities for NetBSD (sysbuild and sysupgrade) and a supporting library for the two tools (shtk). These were all introduced in their corresponding blog posts &amp;mdash;Introducing sysbuild for NetBSD, Introducing sysupgrade for NetBSD and Introducing shtk&amp;mdash; and since then I have heard good comments about them.
About a couple of weeks ago, I started working on the much-needed rewrite of pkg_comp and a supporting standalone tool.</description>
