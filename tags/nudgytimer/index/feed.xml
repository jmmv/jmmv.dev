&lt;p&gt;For the last two years, I had been meaning to write an Android app just for
the sake of it.  I had attempted to do so in short chunks of &amp;ldquo;free time&amp;rdquo;,
but that never played out well: I had to force myself to sit down for a few
hours straight to fight Android Studio and overcome the initial
difficulties in coding for an unknown platform.  That&amp;rsquo;s why, during the
last Thanksgiving week, I took three days off of work to focus on writing
my first Android app.  The goal was to get a basic app that could later be
built on iteratively as open source.  The specifics of the app did not
matter much for this exercise, but I had a simple idea in mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
