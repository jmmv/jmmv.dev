This is all reasonable but there is one detail I don&rsquo;t associate with: Rob claims that whoever is excited by the new C++11 features will not move to Go, because liking new C++ features implies that one likes all the flexibility of C++ and will not enjoy Go&rsquo;s simplicity.</p></p><p class=text-muted>September 4, 2012

In this post, we'll see how this data structure ties to the parsing of the configuration file.<br><br>One goal in the design of the configuration file was to make its contents a simple key/value association (i.e. assigning values to predetermined configuration variables). Of course, the fact that the configuration file is just a Lua script means that additional constructions (conditionals, functions, etc.) can be used to compute these values before assignment, but in the end all we want to have is a collection of values for known keys. The tree data structure does exactly the latter: maintain the mapping of keys to values, and ensuring that only a set of "valid" keys can be set. But, as a data structure, it does not contain any of the "logic" involved in computing those values: that is the job of the script.<br><br>Now, consider that we have the possible following syntaxes in the configuration file:<br><br><tt>simple_variable = "the value"</tt><br><tt>complex.nested.variable = "some other value"</tt><br><br>These assignments map, exactly, to a <tt>tree::set()</tt> function call: the name of the key is passed as the first argument to <tt>tree::set()</tt> and the value is passed as the second argument. (Let's omit types for simplicity.) What we want to do is modify the Lua environment so that these assignments are possible, and that when such assignments happen, the internal tree object gets updated with the new values.<br><br>In order to achieve this, the configuration library <a href=http://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/browse/utils/config/lua_module.cpp>modifies the Lua environment</a> as follows:<br><ul><li>The <tt>newindex</tt> metatable method of <tt>_G</tt> is overridden so that an assignment causes a direct call to the <tt>set</tt> method of the referenced key. The key name is readily available in the <tt>newindex</tt> arguments, so no further magic is needed. This handles the case of "<tt>a = b</tt>" (top-level variables).</li><li>The <tt>index</tt> metatable method of <tt>_G</tt> is overridden so that, if the indexed element is not found, a new table is generated and injected into <tt>_G</tt>. This new table has a metatable of its own that performs the same operations as the <tt>newindex</tt> and <tt>index</tt> herein described. This handles the case of "<tt>a.b = c</tt>", as this trick causes the intermediate tables (in this case "<tt>a</tt>") to be transparently created.</li><li>Each of the tables created by <tt>index</tt> has a "key" metatable field that contains the fully qualified key of the node the table corresponds to. This is necessary to be able to construct the full key to pass to the <tt>set</tt> method.</li><li>There is further magic to ensure that values pre-populated in the tree (aka default values) can be queried from within Lua, and that variables can be set more than once. These details are uninteresting though.</li></ul>At the moment, we deny setting variables that have not been pre-defined in the tree structure, which means that if the user wants to define auxiliary variables or functions, these must be declared <tt>local</tt> to prevent calling into the <tt>_G</tt> hooks. This is quite nice, but we may need to change this later on if we want to export the standard Lua modules to the configuration files.</p><p class=text-muted>June 2, 2012

This class provides a mapping of string keys to arbitrary types: all the nodes of the tree have a textual name, and they can either be inner nodes (no value attached to them), or leaf nodes (an arbitrary type attached as a value to them). The keys represent traversals through such tree, and do this by separating the node names with dots (things of the form <tt>root.inner1.innerN.leaf</tt>).<br><br>The tree class is the in-memory representation of a configuration file, and is the data structure passed around methods and algorithms to tune their behavior. It replaces the previous <tt>config</tt> static structure.<br><br>The following highlights describe the tree class:<br><ul><li><b>Keys are (and thus the tree layout is) pre-registered</b>. One side-effect of moving away from a static C++ structure as the representation of the configuration to a dynamic structure such as a tree is that the compiler cannot longer validate the name of the configuration settings when they are queried. In the past, doing something like <tt>config.architecture</tt> would only compile if <tt>architecture</tt> was a valid structure defined... but now, code like <tt>config["architecture"]</tt> cannot be validated during the build.<br>In order to overcome this limitation, trees must have their keys pre-defined. Pre-defining the keys declares their type within the tree. &nbsp;Accesses to unknown keys results in an error right away, and accesses to pre-defined keys must always happen with their pre-recorded types.<br>Note that pre-defined nodes can, or cannot, hold a value. The concept of "being set" is different than "being defined".</li><li><b>Some nodes can be dynamic</b>. Sometimes we do not know what particular keys are valid within a context. For example, the <tt>test_suites</tt> subtree of the configuration can contain arbitrary test suite names and properties within it, and there is no way for Kyua (at the moment) to know what keys are valid or not.<br>As a result, the tree class allows defining a particular node as "dynamic", at which point accesses to any undefined keys below that node result in the creation of the node.</li><li><b>Type safety</b>. Every node has a type attached to it. The base configuration library provides common types such as <tt>bool_node</tt>, <tt>int_node</tt> and <tt>string_node</tt>, but the consumer can define its own node types to hold any other kind of data type. (It'd be possible, for example, to define a <tt>map_node</tt> to hold a full map as a tree leaf.)<br>The "tricky" (and cool) part of type safety in this context is to avoid exposing type casts to the caller: the caller always knows what type corresponds to every key (because, remember, the caller had to predefine them!), so it knows what type to expect from every node. The tree class achieves this by using template <i>methods</i>, which just query the generic internal nodes and cast them out (after validation) to the requested type.</li><li><b>Plain string representations</b>. The end user has to be able to provide overrides to configuration properties through the command line... and the command line is untyped: everything is a string. The tree library, therefore, needs a mechanism to internalize strings (after validation) and convert them to the particular node types. Similarly, it is interesting to have a way to export the contents of a tree to strings so that they can be shown to the user.</li></ul>With that said, let's see a couple of examples. First, a simple one. Let's create a tree with a couple of fictitious nodes (one a string, one an integer), set some values and then query such values:<br><br><pre>config::tree tree;<br><br>// Predefine the valid keys.<br>tree.define&lt; config::string_node &gt;("kyua.architecture");<br>tree.define&lt; config::int_node &gt;("kyua.timeout");<br><br>// Populate the tree with some sample values.<br>tree.set&lt; config::string_node &gt;("kyua.architecture", "powerpc");<br>tree.set&lt; config::int_node &gt;("kyua.timeout", 300);<br><br>// Query the sample values.<br>const std::string architecture =<br>    tree.lookup&lt; config::string_node &gt;("kyua.architecture");<br>const int timeout =<br>    tree.lookup&lt; config::int_node &gt;("kyua.timeout");</pre><br>Yep, that's it. Note how the code just knows about keys and their types, but does not have to mess around with type casts nor tree nodes. And, if there is any typo in the property names or if there is a type mismatch between the property and its requested node type, the code will fail early. This, coupled with extensive unit tests, ensures that configuration keys are always queried consistently.<br><br>Note that we'd also have set the keys above as follows:<br><br><pre>tree.set_string("kyua.architecture", "powerpc");<br>tree.set_string("kyua.timeout", "300");</pre><br>... which would result in the validation of "300" as a proper integer, conversion of it to a native integer, and storing the resulting number as the integer node it corresponds to. This is useful, again, when reading configuration overrides from the command line as types are not known in that context yet we want to store their values in the same data structure as the values read from the configuration file.<br><br>Let's now see another very simple example showcasing dynamic nodes (which is a real-life example from the current Kyua configuration file):<br><br><pre>config::tree tree;<br><br>// Predefine a subtree as dynamic.<br>tree.define_dynamic("test_suites");<br><br>// Populate the subtree with fictitious values.<br>tree.set&lt; config::string_node &gt;("test_suites.NetBSD.ffs", "ext2fs");<br>tree.set&lt; config::int_node &gt;("test_suites.NetBSD.iterations", 5);<br><br>// And the querying would happen exactly as above with lookup().</pre><br>Indeed, it'd be very cool if this tree type followed more standard STL conventions (iterators, for example). But I didn't really think about this when I started writing this class and, to be honest, I don't need this functionality.<br><br>Now, if you paid close attention to the above, you can start smelling the relation of this structure to the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/browse/examples/kyua.conf>syntax of configuration files</a>. I'll tell you how this ties together with Lua in a later post. (Which may also explain why I chose this particular representation.)</p><p class=text-muted>May 29, 2012

I also hinted that some new code was coming and, after weeks of work, I'm happy to say that it has <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/detail?r=275a6bb6101d8c9ae2f0290cac6c294ac040aeab">just landed in the tree</a>!<br><div><br>I really want to get to explaining the nitty-gritty details of the implementation, but I'll keep these for later. Let's focus first on what the goals for the new configuration module were, as these drove a lot of the implementation details:</div><div><ul><li><b>Key/value pairs representation</b>: The previous configuration system did this already, and it is a pretty good form for a configuration file because it is a simple, understandable and widespread format. Note that I have not said anything yet about the <i>types</i>&nbsp;of the values.</li><li><b>Tree-like representation</b>: The previous configuration schema grouped test-suite specific properties under a "test_suites" map while it left internal run-time properties in the global namespace. The former is perfect and the latter was done just for simplicity. I want to move towards a tree of properties to give context to each of them so that they can be grouped semantically (e.g. <i>kyua.report.*</i>, <i>kyua.runtime.*</i>, etc.). The new code has not changed the structure of the properties yet (to remain compatible with previous files), but it adds very simple support to change this in the shortcoming future.</li><li><b>Single-place parsing and validation</b>: A configuration file is an external representation of a set of properties. This data is read (parsed) once and converted into an in-memory representation. All validation of the values of the properties must happen at this stage, and <i>not when the properties are queried</i>. The reason is that validation of external values must be consistent and has to happen in a controlled location (so that errors can all be reported at the same time).<br>I have seen code in other projects where the configuration file is stored in memory as a set of key/value string pairs and parsing to other types (such as integers, etc.) is delayed until the values are used. The result is that, if a property is queried more than once, the validation will be implemented in different forms, each with its own bugs, which will result in dangerous inconsistencies.</li><li><b>Type safety</b>: This is probably the trickiest bit. Every configuration node must be stored in the type that makes most sense for its value. For example: a timeout in seconds is an integer, so the in-memory representation must be an integer. Or another example: the type describing the "unprivileged user" is a data structure that maps to a system user, yet the configuration file just specifies either a username or a UID.<br>Keeping strict type validation in the code is interesting because it helps to ensure that parsing and validation happen in just a single place: whenever the configuration file is read, every property will have to be converted to its in-memory type, and this means that the validation can only happen at that particular time. <i>Once the data is in memory, we can and have to assume that it is valid</i>. Additionally, strict types ensure that the code querying such properties uses the values as intended, without having to do additional magic to map them to other types.</li><li><b>Extensibility</b>: Parsing a configuration file is a very generic concept, yet the previous code made the mistake of tying this logic with the specific details of Kyua configuration files. A goal of the new code has been to write a library that parses configuration files, and allows the Kyua-specific code to define the schema of the configuration file separately. (No, the library is not shipped separately at this point; it's placed in its own <i>utils::config</i> module.)</li></ul><div>With all this code in place, there are a bunch of things that can now be easily implemented. Consider the following:</div></div><div><ul><li>Properties to define the timeout of test cases depending on their size (long-standing <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/issues/detail?id=5">issue 5</a>).</li><li>Properties to tune the UI behavior: width of the screen, whether to use color or not (no, there is no color support yet), etc.</li><li>Properties to configure how reports look like "by default": if you generate reports of any form frequently, it is very likely that you will want them to look the same every time and hence you will want to define the report settings once in the configuration file.</li><li>Hooks: one of the reasons for using Lua-based configuration files was to allow providing extra customization abilities to the user. Kyua could theoretically call back into Lua code to perform particular actions, and such actions could be explicitly stated by the user in the form of Lua functions. Neither the current configuration code nor Kyua has support for hooks, but the new implementation makes it rather easy to add them.</li></ul><div>And that's all for today. Now that you know what the current code is trying to achieve and why, we will be able to look at how the implementation does all this in the next posts.</div></div></p><p class=text-muted>May 28, 2012

The requirements for the configuration were minimal, as there were very few parameters to be exposed to the user. The implementation was quick and simple to allow further progress on other more-important parts of the project. (Yep, quick is an euphemism for dirty: the implementation of the "configuration class" has to special-case properties everywhere to deal with their particular types... just as the Lua script has to do too.)<div><br></div><div>As I just mentioned in the previous paragraph, the set of parameters exposed through the configuration file were minimal. Let's recap what these are:</div><div><ul><li>Run-time variables: <i>architecture</i> and <i>platform</i>, which are two strings identifying the system; and <i>unprivileged_user</i>, which (if defined) is the name of the user under which to run unprivileged tests as. It is important to mention that the <i>unprivileged_user</i> is internally represented by a data type that includes several properties about a system user, and that it ensures that the data it contains is valid at all times. The fact that every property holds a specific type is an important design requirement.</li><li>Test suite variables: every test suite can accept arbitrary configuration variables. Actually, these are defined by the test programs themselves. All of these properties are strings (and cannot be anything else because ATF test programs have no way of indicating the type of the configuration variables they accept/expect).</li></ul><div>Because of the reduced set of configurable properties, I opted to implement the configuration of the program as a simple data structure with one field per property, and a map of properties to represent the arbitrary test suite variables. The "parser" to populate this structure consists on a Lua module that loads these properties from a Lua script. The module hooks into the Lua metatables to permit things like "<i>test_suites.NetBSD.timeout=20</i>" to work without having to predeclare the intermediate tables.</div><div><br></div><div>Unfortunately, as I keep adding more and more functionality to Kyua, I encounter additional places where a tunable would be appreciated by the end user (e.g. "disallow automatic line wrapping"). Exposing such tunable through a command-line flag would be a possibility, but some of these need to be permanent in order to be useful. It is clear that these properties have to be placed in the configuration file, and attempting to add them to the current codebase shows that the current abstractions in Kyua are not flexible enough.</div><div><br></div><div>So, why am I saying all this? Well: during the last few weeks, I have been working on a new configuration module for Kyua. The goals have been simple:</div><div><ul><li>Have a generic configuration module that parses configuration files only, without any semantics about Kyua (e.g. what variables are valid or not). This ensures that the implementation is extensible and at the right level of abstraction.</li><li>Be able to get rid of the ad-hoc parsing of configuration files.</li><li>Allow defining properties in a strictly-typed tree structure. Think about being able to group properties by function, e.g. "kyua.host.architecture"; this is more or less what we have today for test-suite properties but the implementation is a special-case again and cannot be applied to other tunables.</li></ul></div></div><div>And... <drums>I am pleased to say that this code is about to get merged into the tree just in time for Kyua 0.4. In the next few posts, I will explain what the particular design constraints of this new configuration system were and outline a little bit its implementation. I think it's a pretty cool hack that mixes C++ data structures and Lua scripts in a "transparent" manner, albeit you may think it's too &nbsp;complex. The key part is that, <i>as this new configuration module is <b>not</b> specific to Kyua, you might want to borrow the code/ideas for your own use!</i></drums></div></p><p class=text-muted>May 26, 2012

With RAII, you can wrap non-stack-managed resources into a stack-managed object such that, when the stack-managed object goes out of scope, it releases the corresponding non-stack-managed object. <a href="http://onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/05/04/smart-pointers.html?page=1">Smart pointers</a> are just one example of this technique, but so are IO streams too.<br><br>Before getting into the point of the article, bear with me for a second while I explain what the&nbsp; <a href=http://code.google.com/p/lutok/source/browse/trunk/stack_cleaner.hpp><tt>stack_cleaner</tt></a> object of <a href=http://code.google.com/p/lutok/>Lutok</a> is. The "stack cleaner" takes a reference to a Lua state and records the height of the Lua stack on creation. When the object is destroyed (which happens when the declaring function exits), the stack is returned to its previous height thus ensuring it is clean. It is always a good idea for a function to prevent side-effects by leaving its outside world as it was â€” and, like it or not, the Lua state is part of the outside world because it is an input/output parameter to many functions.<br><br>Let's consider a piece of code <i>without</i> using the stack cleaner:<br><br><pre>void<br>my_function(lutok::state&amp; state, const int foo)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state.push_integer(foo);</pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... do something else in the state ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const int bar = state.to_integer();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (bar != 3) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; state.pop(1); <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throw std::runtime_error("Invalid data!");<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; state.pop(1);<br><br>}</pre><br>Note that we have had to call <tt>state.pop(1)</tt> from "all" exit points of the function to ensure that the stack is left unmodified upon return of <tt>my_function</tt>. Also note that "all exit points" may not be accurate: in a language that supports exceptions, any statement may potentially raise an exception so to be really safe we should do:<br><br><pre>void<br>my_function(lutok::state&amp; state, const int foo)<br>{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state.push_integer(foo);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; try { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ... do something else in the state ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; const int bar = state.to_integer();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; if (bar != 3 <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throw std::runtime_error("Invalid data!");<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; } catch (...) {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; state.pop(1);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throw;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state.pop(1);<br>}</pre><br>... which gets old very quickly. Writing this kind of code is error-prone and boring.<br><br>With an "auto-cleaner" object such as the <tt>stack_cleaner</tt>, we can simplify our code like this:<br><br><pre>void<br>my_function(lutok::state&amp; state, const int foo)<br>{<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; lutok::stack_cleaner cleaner(state);<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state.push_integer(foo);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... do something else in the state ...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const int bar = state.to_integer();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (bar != 3) <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throw std::runtime_error("Invalid data!"); <br>}</pre><br>And we leave the boring task of determining when to actually call <tt>state.pop(1)</tt> to the compiler and the runtime environment. In this particular case, no matter how the <tt>my_function</tt> terminates, we ensure that the Lua stack will be left as the same size as it was before.<br><br>But, as I said earlier, all this was just an introduction to the idea that made me write this post.<br><br>When you declare an auto-cleaner object of any kind, <i>be sure to give it a name</i>. It has happened to me a few times already that I have written the following construct:<br><br><pre>lutok::stack_cleaner(state);</pre><br>... which is syntactically correct, harmless and "looks good" if you don't look closely. The compiler will chew along just fine because, even though we are declaring an anonymous object, its constructor and destructor may be doing who-knows-what, so their code must be called and thus the "unused variable" warning cannot really be raised.<br><br><b>However</b> this does not give us the desired behavior. The cleaner object will be constructed and destructed in the same statement without having a chance to wrap any of the following code, because its scope is just the statement in which it was defined. In other words, the cleaner will have absolutely no effect on the rest of the function and thus will be useless.<br><br>So, moral of the story: always give a name to your auto-cleaner objects so that their scope is correctly defined and their destructor is run when you actually expect:<br><br><pre>lutok::stack_cleaner ANY_NAME_HERE(state);</pre></p><p class=text-muted>September 17, 2011

You can take a look at the <a href=http://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/browse/#svn%2Ftags%2Fkyua-cli-0.2%2Futils%2Flua%253Fstate%253Dclosed>current code as of r129</a>.<br><br>Quoting the previous post:<br><blockquote>The utils::lua library provides thin C++ wrappers around the Lua C API to ease the interaction between C++ and Lua. These wrappers make intensive use of RAII to prevent resource leakage, expose C++-friendly data types, report errors by means of exceptions and ensure that the Lua stack is always left untouched in the face of errors. The library also provides a place (the operations module) to add miscellaneous utility functions built on top of the wrappers.</blockquote>While the RAII wrappers and other C++-specific constructions are a very nice thing to have, this library has to jump through a lot of hoops to interact with binary Lua versions built for C. This makes utils::lua not usable for performance-critical environments. Things would be way easier if utils::lua linked to a Lua binary built for C++, but unfortunately that is not viable in most, if not all, systems with binary packaging systems (read: most Linux distributions, BSD systems, etc.).<br><br>That said, I've had requests from a bunch of people to provide utils::lua separately from Kyua regardless of any performance shortcomings it may have, and this is what I have started doing this weekend. So far, I already have a pretty clumsy standalone package (I'll keep the name to myself for now ;-) that provides this library on its own with the traditional Automake, Autoconf and Libtool support. Once this is a bit better quality, and once I modify Kyua to link against this external library and assess that things work fine, I'll make the decision on how to publish this (but most likely it should be a separate project in Google Code).<br><br>Splitting the code doesn't come with its own issues though: maintaining a separate package will involve more work and hopefully/supposedly, dealing with quite a few feature requests to add missing functionality! Also, it means that utils::lua cannot use any of the other Kyua libraries (utils::sanity for example), so I lose a bit of consistency across the Kyua codebase. I am also not sure about how to share non-library code (in particular, the m4 macros for Autoconf) across the two packages.<br><br>So, my question is: are you interested in utils::lua being shipped separately? :-)&nbsp; Do you have any cool use cases for it that you can share here?<br><br>Thanks!</p><p class=text-muted>September 3, 2011

This class completely hides the internal C type of Lua to ensure that all calls that affect the state go through the <tt>lua::state</tt> class.<br><br>Things get a bit messy when we want to inject native functions into the Lua environment. These functions follow the prototype represented by the <tt>lua_CFunction</tt> type:<blockquote><tt>typedef int (*lua_CFunction)(lua_State*);</tt></blockquote>Now, let's consider this code:<pre>int<br>awesome_native_function(lua_State* state)<br>{<br>    // Uh, we have access to s, so we bypass the lua::state!<br>    ... do something nasty ...<br><br>    // Oh, and we can throw an exception here...<br>    //with bad consequences.<br>}<br><br>void<br>setup(...)<br>{<br>    lua::state state;<br>    state.push_c_function(awesome_native_function);<br>    state.set_global("myfunc");<br>    ... run some script ...<br>}</pre>The fact that we must pass a <tt>lua_CFunction</tt> prototype to the <tt>lua_pushcfunction</tt> object means that such function must have access to the raw <tt>lua_State*</tt> pointer... which we want to avoid.<br><br>What we really want is the caller code to define a function such as:<blockquote><tt>typedef int (*cxx_function)(lua::state&)</tt></blockquote>In an ideal world, the <tt>lua::state</tt> class would implement a <tt>push_cxx_function</tt> that took a <tt>cxx_function</tt>, generated a thin C wrapper and injected such generated wrapper into Lua. Unfortunately, we are not in an ideal world: C++ does not have high-order functions and thus the "generate a wrapper function" part of the previous proposal does not really work.<br><br>What we can do instead, though, is to make the creation of C wrappers for these C++ functions trivial. And this is what <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/detail?r=42">r42</a> did. The approach I took is similar to this overly-simplified (and broken) example:<pre>template&lt; cxx_function Function &gt;<br>int<br>wrap_cxx_function(lua_State* state)<br>{<br>    try {<br>        lua::state state_wrapper(state);<br>        return Function(state_wrapper);<br>    } catch (...) {<br>        luaL_error(state, "Geez, don't go into C's land!");<br>    }<br>}</pre>This template wrapper takes a <tt>cxx_function</tt> object and generates a corresponding C function <i>at compile time</i>. This wrapper function ensures that C++ state does not propagate into the C world, as that often has catastrophical consequences. (Due to language limitations, the input function must have external linkage. So no, it cannot be static.)<br><br>As a result, we can rewrite our original snippet as:<pre>int<br>awesome_native_function(lua::state& state)<br>{<br>    // See, we cannot access lua_State* now.<br><br>    ... do something ...<br>    throw std::runtime_error("And we can even do this!");<br>}<br><br>void<br>setup(...)<br>{<br>    lua::state state;<br>    state.push_c_function(<br>        wrap_cxx_function< awesome_native_function >);<br>    state.set_global("myfunc");<br>    ... run some script ...<br>}</pre>Neat? I think so, but maybe not so much. I'm pretty sure there are cooler ways of achieving the above purpose in a cleaner way, but this one works nicely and has few overhead.</p><p class=text-muted>January 17, 2011

Later, I announced the <a href=/2011/01/c-interface-to-lua.html>new C++ interface for Lua</a> implemented within <a href=http://code.google.com/p/kyua/>Kyua</a>. And today, I would like to talk about the specific mechanism I implemented in this library to deal with the Lua errors.<br><br>The first thing to keep in mind is that the whole purpose of Lua in the context of Kyua is to parse configuration files. This is an infrequent operation, so <i>high performance does not matter</i>: it is more valuable to me to be able to write robust algorithms fast than to have them run at optimal speed. The other key point to consider is that I want Kyua to be able to use prebuilt Lua libraries, which are built as C binaries.<br><br>The approach I took is to wrap every single unsafe Lua C API call in a "thin" (FSVO thin depending on the case) wrapper that gets called by <tt>lua_pcall</tt>. Anything that runs inside the wrapper is safe to Lua errors, as they are caught and safely reported to the caller.<br><br>Lets examine how this works by taking a look at an example: the wrapping of <tt>lua_getglobal</tt>. We have the following code (copy pasted from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/browse/trunk/kyua-cli/utils/lua/wrap.cpp?spec=svn39&r=39">utils/lua/wrap.cpp</a> file but hand-edited for publishing here):<pre>static int<br>protected_getglobal(lua_State* state)<br>{<br>    lua_getglobal(state, lua_tostring(state, -1));<br>    return 1;<br>}<br><br>void<br>lua::state::get_global(const std::string& name)<br>{<br>    lua_pushcfunction(_pimpl->lua_state, protected_getglobal);<br>    lua_pushstring(_pimpl->lua_state, name.c_str());<br>    if (lua_pcall(_pimpl->lua_state, 1, 1, 0) != 0)<br>        throw lua::api_error::from_stack(_pimpl->lua_state,<br>            "lua_getglobal");<br>}</pre>The <tt>state::get_global</tt> method is my public wrapper for the <tt>lua_getglobal</tt> Lua C API call. This wrapper first prepares the Lua stack by pushing the address of the C function to call and its parameters and then issues a <tt>lua_pcall</tt> call that executes the C function in a Lua protected environment.<br><br>In this case, the argument preparation for <tt>protected_getglobal</tt> is trivial because the <tt>lua_getglobal</tt> call does not require access to any preexisting values on the Lua stack. Things get much trickier when that happens as in the case of the <tt>lua_getglobal</tt> wrapper. I'll leave understanding how to do this as an exercise to the reader (but you can cheat by looking at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/browse/trunk/kyua-cli/utils/lua/wrap.cpp?spec=svn39&r=39#154">line 154</a>).<br><br>Anyway. The above looks all very nice and safe and the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/browse/trunk/kyua-cli/utils/lua/wrap_test.cpp?spec=svn39&r=39#112">tests for the state::get_global function</a>, even the ones that intentionally cause a failure, all work fine. So we are good, right? <i>Nope!</i> Unfortunately, the code above is not fully safe to Lua errors.<br><br>In order to prepare the <tt>lua_pcall</tt> execution, the code must push values on the stack. As it turns out, both <tt>lua_pushcfunction</tt> and <tt>lua_pushstring</tt> <i>can</i> fail if they run out of memory (OOM). Such failure would of course be captured inside a protected environment... but we have a little chicken'n'egg problem here. That said, OOM failures are rare so I'm going to leverage this fact and not worry about it. (Note to self: install a <tt>lua_atpanic</tt> handler to complain loudly if that ever happens.)<br><br><b>Addendum</b>: Bundling Lua within my program and building it as a C++ binary with exception reporting enabled in <tt>luaconf.h</tt> would magically solve all my issues. I know. But I don't fancy the idea of bundling the library into my source tree for a variety of reasons.</p><p class=text-muted>January 14, 2011

To get an initial idea on what these are, take a look at the <a href=http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#3.7>Functions and Types</a> section and pay attention to the third field of a function description (the one denoted by 'x' in the introduction).<div><br></div><div>Dealing with the errors raised by these functions is tricky, not to say a nightmare. Also, the <a href=http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#3.6>ridiculously-short documentation on this topic</a> does not help. This post is dedicated to explain how these errors may be handled along with the advantages and disadvantages of each case.</div><div><br></div><div>The Lua C API provides two modes of execution: protected and unprotected. When in protected mode, all errors caused by Lua are caught and reported to the caller in a controlled manner. When in unprotected mode, the errors just abort the execution of the calling process by default. So, one would think: just run the code in protected mode, right? Yeah, well... entering protected mode is nontrivial and it has its own particularities that make interaction with C++ problematic.<br><br></div><div>Let's analyze error reporting by considering a simple example: the <tt>lua_gettable</tt> function. The following Lua code would error out when executed:<pre>my_array = nil<br>return my_array["test"]</pre>... which is obvious because indexing a non-table object is a mistake. Now let's consider how this code would look like in C (modulo the <tt>my_array</tt> assignment):<pre>lua_getglobal(state, "my_array");<br>lua_pushstring(state, "test");<br>lua_gettable(state, -2);</pre>Simple, huh? Sure, but as it turns out, <i>any</i> of the API calls (not just <tt>lua_gettable</tt>) in this code can raise errors (I'll call them <i>unsafe</i> functions). What this means is that, unless you run the code with a <tt>lua_pcall</tt> wrapper, your program will simply <i>exit</i> in the face of a Lua error. Uh, your scripting language can "crash" your host program out of your control? Not nice.</div><div><br></div><div>What would be nice is if each of the Lua C API unsafe functions reported an error (as a return value or whatever) and allowed the caller to decide what to do. Ideally, no state would change in the face of an error. Unfortunately, that is not the case but it is exactly what I would like to do. I am writing a C++ wrapper for Lua in the context of Kyua and fine granularity in error reporting means that automatic cleanup of resources managed by RAII is trivial.</div><div><br></div><div>Let's analyze the options that we have to control errors caused within the Lua C API. I will explain in a later post the one I have chosen for the wrapper in Kyua (it has to be later because I'm not settled yet!).</div><div><br><span class=Apple-style-span><b>Install a panic handler</b></span><div><br></div><div>Whenever Lua code runs in an unprotected environment, one can use <tt>lua_atpanic</tt> to install a handler for errors. The function provided by the user is executed when the error occurs and, if the panic function returns, the program exits. To prevent exiting prematurely, one could opt for two mechanisms:<br><ul><li>Make the panic handler raise a C++ exception. Sounds nice, right? Well, it does not work. The Lua library is generally built as a C binary which means that our panic handler will be called from within a C environment. As a result, we cannot throw an exception from our C++ handler and expect things to work: the exception won't propagate correctly from a C++ context to a C context and then back to C++. Most likely, the program will abort as soon as we leave the C++ world and enter C to unwind the stack.</li><li>Use <tt>setjmp</tt> before the call to the unsafe Lua function and recover with <tt>longjmp</tt> from within the panic handler. It turns out that this does work <i>but</i> with one important caveat: the stack is completely cleared before the call to the panic handler.

We would need to provide a separate C/C++ function that runs all unsafe code and then call it by means of <tt>lua_pcall</tt> (or <tt>lua_cpcall</tt>) so that errors are captured and reported in a controlled manner. This seems very efficient... albeit not transparent and will surely cause issues.</div><div><br></div><div>Why is this problematic?

Doom's day.<br><br>Yes, I know Lua can be rebuilt to report internal errors by means of exceptions which would make this particular problem a non-issue... but this rules out any pre-packaged Lua binaries (the default is to use <tt>longjmp</tt> and henceforth what packaged binaries use). I do not want to embed Lua into my source tree.

The main purpose of this auxiliary library is to ensure that global interpreter resources such as the global state or the execution stack are kept consistent in the presence of exceptions &mdash; and, in particular, that none of these are leaked due to programming mistakes when handling error codes.<br><br>To illustrate this point, let's forget about Lua and consider a simpler case. Suppose we lost the ability to pass arguments and return values from functions in C++ and all we have is a stack that we pass around. With this in mind, we could implement a <tt>multiply</tt> function as follows:<pre>void multiply(std::stack< int >& context) {<br>    const int arg1 = context.top();<br>    context.pop();<br>    const int arg2 = context.top();<br>    context.pop();<br>    context.push(arg1 * arg2);<br>}</pre>And we could call our function as this:<pre>std::stack< int > context;<br>context.push(5);<br>context.push(6);<br>multiply(context);<br>const int result = s.top();<br>s.pop();</pre>In fact, my friends, this is more-or-less what your C/C++ compiler is internally doing when converting code to assembly language. The way the stack is organized to perform calls is known as the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_conventions>calling conventions</a> of an ABI (language/platform combination).<br><br>Anyway, back to our point. One important property of such a stack-based system is that any function that deals with the stack must leave it in a consistent state: if the function pushes temporary values (read: local variables) into the stack, such temporary values must be gone upon return no matter how the function terminates. Otherwise, the caller will not find the stack as it expects, which will surely cause trouble at a later stage. The above example works just fine because our function is extremely simple and does not put anything on the stack.<br><br>But things get messier when our functions can fail halfway through, and, in particular, if such failures are signaled by exceptions. In these cases, the function will abort abruptly and the function must take care to clean up any values that may still be left on the stack. Let's consider another example:<pre>void magic(std::stack< int >& context) {<br>    const int arg1 = context.top();<br>    context.pop();<br>    const int arg2 = context.top();<br>    context.pop();<br><br>    context.push(arg1 * arg2);<br>    context.push(arg1 / arg2);<br>    try {<br>        ... do something with the two values on top ...<br><br>        context.push(arg1 - arg2);<br>        try {<br>            ... do something with the three values on top ...<br>        } catch (...) {<br>            context.pop();  // arg1 - arg2<br>            throw;<br>        }<br>        context.pop();<br>    } catch (...) {<br>        context.pop();  // arg1 / arg2<br>        context.pop();  // arg1 * arg2<br>        throw;<br>    }<br>    context.pop();<br>    context.pop();<br>}</pre>The above is a completely fictitious and useless function, but serves to illustrate the point. <tt>magic()</tt> starts by pushing two values on the stack and then performs some computation that reads these two values. It later pushes an additional value and does some more computations on the three temporary values that are on the top of the stack.<br><br>The "problem" is that the computation code can throw an exception. If it does, we must sanitize the stack to remove the two or three values we have already pushed. Otherwise, the caller will receive the exception, it will assume nothing has happened, and will leak values on the stack (bad thing). To prevent this, we have added a couple of try/catch clauses to capture these possible exceptions and to clean up the already-pushed values before exiting the function. Unfortunately, this gets old very quickly: having to add try/catch statements surrounding every call is boring, ugly, and hard to read (remember that, <i>potentially</i>, any statement can throw an exception). You can see this in the example above with the two nested try/catch blocks.<br><br>To mitigate this situation, we can apply a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization>RAII</a>-like technique to make popping elements on errors completely transparent and automated. If we can make it transparent, writing the code is easier and reading it is trivial; if we can make it automated, we can be certain that our error paths (rarely tested!) correctly clean up any global state. In C++, destructors are <i>deterministically</i> executed whenever a variable goes out of scope, so we can use this to our advantage to clean up temporary values. Let's consider this class:<pre>class temp_stack {<br>    std::stack< int >& _stack;<br>    int _pop_count;<br><br>public:<br>    temp_stack(std::stack< int >& stack_) :<br>        _stack(stack_), _pop_count(0) {}<br><br>    ~temp_stack(void)<br>    {<br>        while (_pop_count-- > 0)<br>            _stack.pop();<br>    }<br><br>    void push(int i)<br>    {<br>        _stack.push(i);<br>        _pop_count++;<br>    }<br>};</pre>With this, we can rewrite our function as:<pre>void magic(std::stack< int >& context) {<br>    const int arg1 = context.top();<br>    context.pop();<br>    const int arg2 = context.top();<br>    context.pop();<br><br>    temp_stack temp(context);<br><br>    temp_stack.push(arg1 * arg2);<br>    temp_stack.push(arg1 / arg2);<br>    ... do something with the two values on top ...<br><br>    temp_stack.push(arg1 - arg2);<br>    ... do something with the three values on top ...<br><br>    // Yes, we can return now.  No need to do manual pop()s!<br>}</pre>Simple, huh? Our <tt>temp_stack</tt> function keeps track of how many elements have been pushed on the stack. Whenever the function terminates, be it due to reaching the end of the body or due to an exception thrown anywhere, the <tt>temp_stack</tt> destructor will remove all elements previously registered from the stack. This ensures that the function leaves the global state (the stack) as it was on entry &mdash; modulo the function parameters consumed as part of the calling conventions.<br><br>So how does all this play together with Lua? Well, Lua maintains a stack to communicate parameters and return values between C and Lua. Such stack can be managed in a similar way with a RAII class, which makes it very easy to write native functions that deal with the stack and clean it up correctly in all cases. I would like to show you some non-fictitious code right now, but it's not ready yet ;-) But when it is, it will be part of <a href=http://code.google.com/p/kyua/>Kyua</a>. Stay tuned!<br><br>And, to conclude: to make C++ code robust, wrap objects that need manual clean up (pointers, file descriptors, etc.) with small wrapper classes that perform such clean up on destruction. These classes are typically fully inlined and contain a single member field, so they do not impose any performance penalty. But, on the contrary, your code can avoid the need of many try/catch blocks, which are tricky to get right and hard to validate. (Unfortunately, this technique cannot be applied in, e.g. Java or Python, because the execution of the class destructors is completely non-deterministic and not guaranteed to happen whatsoever!)</p><p class=text-muted>December 27, 2010

This tool has to support two modes: one to generate a single trace for the whole application and one to generate one trace per parallel region of the application.<br><br>In the initial versions of my rewrite, I followed the idea of the previous version of the tool: have a <tt>-split</tt> flag in the frontend that enables or disables the behavior described above. This flag was backed by an abstract class, <tt>Tracer</tt>, and two implementations: <tt>PlainTracer</tt> and <tt>SplittedTracer</tt>. The thread-initialization callback of the tool then allocated one of these objects for every new thread and the <i>per-instruction injected code</i> used a pointer to the interface to call the appropriate specialized instrumentation routine. This pretty much looked like this:<pre>void<br>thread_start_callback(int tid, ...)<br>{<br>    if (splitting)<br>        tracers[tid] = new SplittedTracer();<br>    else<br>        tracers[tid] = new PlainTracer();<br>}<br><br>void<br>per_instruction_callback(...)<br>{<br>    Tracer* t = tracers[PIN_ThreadId()];<br>    t->instruction_callback(...);<br>}</pre>I knew from the very beginning that such an implementation was going to be inefficient due to the pointer dereference at each instruction and the vtable lookup for the correct virtual method implementation. However, it was a very quick way to move forward because I could reuse some small parts of the old implementation.<br><br>There were two ways to optimize this: the first one involved writing different versions of <tt>per_instruction_callback</tt>, one for plain tracing and the other for splitted tracing, and then deciding which one to insert depending on the flag. The other way was to use template metaprogramming.<br><br>As you can imagine, this being C++, I opted to use template metaprogramming to heavily abstract the code in the Pin tool. Now, I have an abstract core parametrized on the Tracer type. When instantiated, I provide the correct Tracer class and the compiler does all the magic for me. With this design, there is no need to have a parent Tracer class &mdash; though I'd welcome having C++0x concepts available &mdash;, and the callbacks can be easily inlined because there is no run-time vtable lookup. It looks something like this:<pre>template< class Tracer ><br>class BasicTool {<br>    Tracer* tracers[MAX_THREADS];<br><br>    Tracer* allocate_tracer(void) const = 0;<br><br>public:<br>    Tracer*<br>    get_tracer(int tid)<br>    {<br>        return tracers[tid];<br>    }<br>};<br><br>class PlainTool : public BasicTool< PlainTracer > {<br>    PlainTracer*<br>    allocate_tracer(void) const<br>    {<br>        return new PlainTracer();<br>    }<br><br>public:<br>    ...<br>} the_plain_tool;<br><br>// This is tool-specific, non-templated yet.<br>void<br>per_instruction_callback(...)<br>{<br>    the_plain_tool.get_tracer(PIN_ThreadId()).instruction_callback(...);<br>}</pre>What this design also does is force me to have two different Pin tools: one for plain tracing and another one for splitted tracing. Of course, I chose it to be this way because I'm not a fan of run-time options (the <tt>-split</tt> flag). Having two separate tools with well-defined, non-optional features makes testing much, much easier and... follows the Unix philosophy of having each tool do exactly one thing, but doing it right!<br><br>Result: around a 15% speedup. And C++ was supposed to be slow? ;-) You just need to know what the language provides you and choose wisely. (Read: my initial, naive prototype had a run-time of 10 minutes to trace part of a small benchmark; after several rounds of optimizations, it's down to 1 minute and 50 seconds to trace the <i>whole</i> benchmark!)<br><br>Disclaimer: The code above is an oversimplification of what the tool contains. It is completely fictitious and obviates many details. I will admit, though, that the real code is too complex at the moment. I'm looking for ways to simplify it.</p><p class=text-muted>May 7, 2009

Here is how.<br><br>In C, when you need to check for the limits of native numeric types, such as <tt>int</tt> or <tt>unsigned long</tt>, you include the <tt>limits.h</tt> header file and then use the <tt>INT_MIN</tt>/<tt>INT_MAX</tt> and <tt>ULONG_MAX</tt> macros respectively. In the C++ world, there is a corresponding <tt>climits</tt> header file to get the definition of these macros, so I always thought this was the way to follow.<br><br>However, it turns out that the C++ standard defines a <tt>limits</tt> header file too, which provides the <tt>numeric_limits&lt;T></tt> template. This template class is specialized in <lt>T</lt> for every numeric type and provides a set of static methods to query properties about the corresponding type. The simplest ones are <tt>min()</tt> and <tt>max()</tt>, which are what we need to replace the old-style <tt>*_MIN</tt> and <tt>*_MAX</tt> macros.<br><br>As an example, this C code:<pre>#include &lt;limits.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;<br><br>int<br>main(void)<br>{<br>    printf("Integer range: %d to %dn", INT_MIN, INT_MAX);<br>    return EXIT_SUCCESS;<br>}</pre>becomes the following in C++:<pre>#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;<br>#include &lt;limits&gt;<br><br>int<br>main(void)<br>{<br>    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Integer range: "<br>              &lt;&lt; std::numeric_limits&lt; int &gt::min()<br>              &lt;&lt; " to "<br>              &lt;&lt; std::numeric_limits&lt; int &gt::max()<br>              &lt;&lt; "n";<br>    return EXIT_SUCCESS;<br>}</pre>Check out the <a href=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/std/limits/numeric_limits/>documentation</a> for more details on additional methods!</p><p class=text-muted>May 4, 2009

But if you just think a little bit about it, just a little, this cannot ever be the case: how could the compiler tell the difference between a class definition in a header file and a class definition in a source file?

However, the way I wrote these tests was a hack since the first day: I use automake to generate a temporary library that builds small source files, each one including one of the public header files. This approach works but has two drawbacks. First, if you do not have the source tree, you cannot reproduce these tests -- and one of ATF's major features is the ability to install tests and reproduce them even if you install from binaries, remember? And second, it's not reusable: I now find myself needing to do this exact same thing in another project... what if I could just use ATF for it?<br><br>Even if the above were not an issue, build-time checks are a nice thing to have in virtually every project that installs libraries. You need to make sure that the installed library is linkable to new source code and, currently, there is no easy way to do this.

How do you provide a portable-enough interface for the callers?<br><br>The approach I have in mind involves caching the same compiler and flags used to build ATF itself and using those as defaults anywhere ATF needs to run the compiler itself. Then, make ATF provide some helper check functions that call the compiler for specific purposes and hide all the required logic inside them. That should work, I expect.

Why? First because this is C++, so you should be using iostreams. Second because by using iostreams you do not have to think about the correct printf-formatter for every type you need to print. And third because it obviously relied on the preprocessor and, how not, debug builds were already broken.<br><br>I wanted to come up with an approach to print debug messages that involved the preprocessor as less as possible. This application (a simulator) needs to be extremely efficient in non-debug builds, so leaving calls to printf all around that internally translated to noops at <tt>runtime</tt> wasn't a nice option because some serious overhead would still be left. So, if you don't use the preprocessor, how can you achieve this? Simple: current compilers have very good optimizers so you can rely on them to do the right thing for release builds.<br><br>The approach I use is as follows: I define a custom <tt>debug_stream</tt> class that contains a reference to a <tt>std::ostream</tt> object. Then, I provide a custom <tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt> that delegates the insertion to the output stream. Here is the only place where the preprocessor is involved: a small conditional is used to omit the delegation in release builds:<pre>template&lt; typename T &gt;<br>inline<br>debug_stream&<br>operator<<(debug_stream& d, const T& t)<br>{<br>#if !defined(NDEBUG)<br>    d.get() &lt;&lt; t;<br>#endif // !defined(NDEBUG)<br>    return d;<br>}</pre>There is also a global instance of a <tt>debug_stream</tt> called <tt>debug</tt>. With this in mind, I can later print debugging messages anywhere in the code as follows:<pre>debug << "This is a debug message!n";</pre>So how does this not introduce any overhead in release builds?<br><br>In release builds, <tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt> is effectively a noop. It does nothing. As long as the compiler can determine this, it will strip out the calls to the insertion operator.<br><br>But there is an important caveat. This approach requires you to be extremely careful in what you insert in the stream. Any object you construct as part of the insertion or any function you call may have side effects. Therefore, the compiler must generate the call to the code anyway because it cannot predict what its effects will be. How do you avoid that? There are two approaches. The first one involves defining everything involved in the debug call as inline or static; the trick is to make the compiler <i>see</i> all the code involved and thus be able to strip it out after seeing it has no side effects. The second approach is simply to <i>avoid</i> such object constructions or function calls completely. Debug-specific code should not have side effects, or otherwise you risk having different application behavior in debug and release builds! Not nice at all.<br><br>A last note: the above is just a proof of concept. The code we have right now is more complex than what I showed above as it supports debug classes, the selection of which classes to print at runtime and prefixes every line with the class name. All of this requires several inline magic to get things right but it seems to be working just fine now :-)<br><br>So, the conclusion: in most situations, <b>you do not need to use the preprocessor</b>. Find a way around it and your developers will be happier. Really.</p><p class=text-muted>March 2, 2009

I hope to reproduce the main idea behind the problem correctly, but my memory is a bit fuzzy.<div><br></div><div>Can you guess why the following program fails to compile due to an error in the call to <tt>equals</tt> from within <tt>main</tt>?

The content was deleted sometime in 2019 but I was lucky enough to <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615153924/http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/05/04/smart-pointers.html>find a copy</a> in the WayBack Machine.

Because it supports object-oriented capabilities and has powerful object libraries&mdash;such as the STL or Boost&mdash;one can quickly implement robust, high-level systems. On the other hand, thanks to its C roots, C++ allows the implementation of very low-level code. This has advantages but also carries some disadvantages, especially when one attempts to write high-level applications.</p></p><p class=text-muted>May 4, 2006
