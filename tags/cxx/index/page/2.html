Why may unused parameters appear? You would think that unused parameters should never exist: if the parameter is not necessary as an input, it should not be there in the first place! That&rsquo;s a pretty good argument, but it does not hold when polymorphism enters the picture: if you want to have different implementations of a single API, such API will have to provide, on input, a superset of all the data required by all the possible implementations.</p><p class=text-muted>February 16, 2015

If you have ever used the Boost libraries, you may have noticed that aside from the regular hpp header files, they also provide a bunch of accompanying ipp files.
ipp files, in the general case, are used to provide the implementation for a template class defined in a corresponding hpp file. This stems from the fact that, in C++, the code for such template definitions must be available whenever the class is instantiated, and this in turn means that the template definitions cannot be placed in separate modules as is customary with non-template classes. In other words: putting the template definitions in cpp files just does not work. (I hear the C++ standards committee wants to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; this but I forget the details now and cannot find a reference.)</p><p class=text-muted>December 2, 2013

As a strong C++ dev and googler (hopefully with some #golang exposure), what&rsquo;s your opinion on @rob_pike post? (goo.gl/xlMi4)
The answer deserves much more than my original reply included, so here it goes.
First of all, I found Rob&rsquo;s article quite interesting. Basically, the authors of Go never expected Go to be more widely adopted by Python users than C++ users. In fact, their original goal was to create a replacement for C++ as a systems programming language. The rationale for this is that C++ users like the verbosity and flexibility of the language, with all of its special cases, while Python users like simplicity and switch to Go when they look for the performance bump. This is all reasonable but there is one detail I don&rsquo;t associate with: Rob claims that whoever is excited by the new C++11 features will not move to Go, because liking new C++ features implies that one likes all the flexibility of C++ and will not enjoy Go&rsquo;s simplicity.</p><p class=text-muted>September 4, 2012

In this post, we'll see how this data structure ties to the parsing of the configuration file.
One goal in the design of the configuration file was to make its contents a simple key/value association (i.e. assigning values to predetermined configuration variables). Of course, the fact that the configuration file is just a Lua script means that additional constructions (conditionals, functions, etc.) can be used to compute these values before assignment, but in the end all we want to have is a collection of values for known keys. The tree data structure does exactly the latter: maintain the mapping of keys to values, and ensuring that only a set of "valid" keys can be set. But, as a data structure, it does not contain any of the "logic" involved in computing those values: that is the job of the script.
Now, consider that we have the possible following syntaxes in the configuration file:
simple_variable = "the value"
complex.nested.variable = "some other value"
These assignments map, exactly, to a tree::set() function call: the name of the key is passed as the first argument to tree::set() and the value is passed as the second argument. (Let's omit types for simplicity.) What we want to do is modify the Lua environment so that these assignments are possible, and that when such assignments happen, the internal tree object gets updated with the new values.
In order to achieve this, the configuration library modifies the Lua environment as follows:
The newindex metatable method of _G is overridden so that an assignment causes a direct call to the set method of the referenced key. The key name is readily available in the newindex arguments, so no further magic is needed. This handles the case of "a = b" (top-level variables).The index metatable method of _G is overridden so that, if the indexed element is not found, a new table is generated and injected into _G. This new table has a metatable of its own that performs the same operations as the newindex and index herein described. This handles the case of "a.b = c", as this trick causes the intermediate tables (in this case "a") to be transparently created.Each of the tables created by index has a "key" metatable field that contains the fully qualified key of the node the table corresponds to. This is necessary to be able to construct the full key to pass to the set method.There is further magic to ensure that values pre-populated in the tree (aka default values) can be queried from within Lua, and that variables can be set more than once. These details are uninteresting though.At the moment, we deny setting variables that have not been pre-defined in the tree structure, which means that if the user wants to define auxiliary variables or functions, these must be declared local to prevent calling into the _G hooks. This is quite nice, but we may need to change this later on if we want to export the standard Lua modules to the configuration files.</p><p class=text-muted>June 2, 2012

This class provides a mapping of string keys to arbitrary types: all the nodes of the tree have a textual name, and they can either be inner nodes (no value attached to them), or leaf nodes (an arbitrary type attached as a value to them). The keys represent traversals through such tree, and do this by separating the node names with dots (things of the form root.inner1.innerN.leaf).
The tree class is the in-memory representation of a configuration file, and is the data structure passed around methods and algorithms to tune their behavior. It replaces the previous config static structure.
The following highlights describe the tree class:
Keys are (and thus the tree layout is) pre-registered. One side-effect of moving away from a static C++ structure as the representation of the configuration to a dynamic structure such as a tree is that the compiler cannot longer validate the name of the configuration settings when they are queried. In the past, doing something like config.architecture would only compile if architecture was a valid structure defined... but now, code like config["architecture"] cannot be validated during the build.
In order to overcome this limitation, trees must have their keys pre-defined. Pre-defining the keys declares their type within the tree. &nbsp;Accesses to unknown keys results in an error right away, and accesses to pre-defined keys must always happen with their pre-recorded types.
Note that pre-defined nodes can, or cannot, hold a value. The concept of "being set" is different than "being defined".Some nodes can be dynamic. Sometimes we do not know what particular keys are valid within a context. For example, the test_suites subtree of the configuration can contain arbitrary test suite names and properties within it, and there is no way for Kyua (at the moment) to know what keys are valid or not.
As a result, the tree class allows defining a particular node as "dynamic", at which point accesses to any undefined keys below that node result in the creation of the node.Type safety. Every node has a type attached to it. The base configuration library provides common types such as bool_node, int_node and string_node, but the consumer can define its own node types to hold any other kind of data type. (It'd be possible, for example, to define a map_node to hold a full map as a tree leaf.)
The "tricky" (and cool) part of type safety in this context is to avoid exposing type casts to the caller: the caller always knows what type corresponds to every key (because, remember, the caller had to predefine them!), so it knows what type to expect from every node. The tree class achieves this by using template methods, which just query the generic internal nodes and cast them out (after validation) to the requested type.Plain string representations. The end user has to be able to provide overrides to configuration properties through the command line... and the command line is untyped: everything is a string. The tree library, therefore, needs a mechanism to internalize strings (after validation) and convert them to the particular node types. Similarly, it is interesting to have a way to export the contents of a tree to strings so that they can be shown to the user.With that said, let's see a couple of examples. First, a simple one. Let's create a tree with a couple of fictitious nodes (one a string, one an integer), set some values and then query such values:
config::tree tree;
// Predefine the valid keys.
tree.define&lt; config::string_node >("kyua.architecture");
tree.define&lt; config::int_node >("kyua.timeout");
// Populate the tree with some sample values.
tree.set&lt; config::string_node >("kyua.architecture", "powerpc");
tree.set&lt; config::int_node >("kyua.timeout", 300);
// Query the sample values.
const std::string architecture =
tree.lookup&lt; config::string_node >("kyua.architecture");
const int timeout =
tree.lookup&lt; config::int_node >("kyua.timeout");
Yep, that's it. Note how the code just knows about keys and their types, but does not have to mess around with type casts nor tree nodes. And, if there is any typo in the property names or if there is a type mismatch between the property and its requested node type, the code will fail early. This, coupled with extensive unit tests, ensures that configuration keys are always queried consistently.
Note that we'd also have set the keys above as follows:
tree.set_string("kyua.architecture", "powerpc");
tree.set_string("kyua.timeout", "300");
... which would result in the validation of "300" as a proper integer, conversion of it to a native integer, and storing the resulting number as the integer node it corresponds to. This is useful, again, when reading configuration overrides from the command line as types are not known in that context yet we want to store their values in the same data structure as the values read from the configuration file.
Let's now see another very simple example showcasing dynamic nodes (which is a real-life example from the current Kyua configuration file):
config::tree tree;
// Predefine a subtree as dynamic.
tree.define_dynamic("test_suites");
// Populate the subtree with fictitious values.
tree.set&lt; config::string_node >("test_suites.NetBSD.ffs", "ext2fs");
tree.set&lt; config::int_node >("test_suites.NetBSD.iterations", 5);
// And the querying would happen exactly as above with lookup().
Indeed, it'd be very cool if this tree type followed more standard STL conventions (iterators, for example). But I didn't really think about this when I started writing this class and, to be honest, I don't need this functionality.
Now, if you paid close attention to the above, you can start smelling the relation of this structure to the syntax of configuration files. I'll tell you how this ties together with Lua in a later post. (Which may also explain why I chose this particular representation.)</p><p class=text-muted>May 29, 2012

I also hinted that some new code was coming and, after weeks of work, I'm happy to say that it has just landed in the tree!
I really want to get to explaining the nitty-gritty details of the implementation, but I'll keep these for later. Let's focus first on what the goals for the new configuration module were, as these drove a lot of the implementation details:Key/value pairs representation: The previous configuration system did this already, and it is a pretty good form for a configuration file because it is a simple, understandable and widespread format. Note that I have not said anything yet about the types&nbsp;of the values.Tree-like representation: The previous configuration schema grouped test-suite specific properties under a "test_suites" map while it left internal run-time properties in the global namespace. The former is perfect and the latter was done just for simplicity. I want to move towards a tree of properties to give context to each of them so that they can be grouped semantically (e.g. kyua.report.*, kyua.runtime.*, etc.). The new code has not changed the structure of the properties yet (to remain compatible with previous files), but it adds very simple support to change this in the shortcoming future.Single-place parsing and validation: A configuration file is an external representation of a set of properties. This data is read (parsed) once and converted into an in-memory representation. All validation of the values of the properties must happen at this stage, and not when the properties are queried. The reason is that validation of external values must be consistent and has to happen in a controlled location (so that errors can all be reported at the same time).
I have seen code in other projects where the configuration file is stored in memory as a set of key/value string pairs and parsing to other types (such as integers, etc.) is delayed until the values are used. The result is that, if a property is queried more than once, the validation will be implemented in different forms, each with its own bugs, which will result in dangerous inconsistencies.Type safety: This is probably the trickiest bit. Every configuration node must be stored in the type that makes most sense for its value. For example: a timeout in seconds is an integer, so the in-memory representation must be an integer. Or another example: the type describing the "unprivileged user" is a data structure that maps to a system user, yet the configuration file just specifies either a username or a UID.
Keeping strict type validation in the code is interesting because it helps to ensure that parsing and validation happen in just a single place: whenever the configuration file is read, every property will have to be converted to its in-memory type, and this means that the validation can only happen at that particular time. Once the data is in memory, we can and have to assume that it is valid. Additionally, strict types ensure that the code querying such properties uses the values as intended, without having to do additional magic to map them to other types.Extensibility: Parsing a configuration file is a very generic concept, yet the previous code made the mistake of tying this logic with the specific details of Kyua configuration files. A goal of the new code has been to write a library that parses configuration files, and allows the Kyua-specific code to define the schema of the configuration file separately. (No, the library is not shipped separately at this point; it's placed in its own utils::config module.)With all this code in place, there are a bunch of things that can now be easily implemented. Consider the following:Properties to define the timeout of test cases depending on their size (long-standing issue 5).Properties to tune the UI behavior: width of the screen, whether to use color or not (no, there is no color support yet), etc.Properties to configure how reports look like "by default": if you generate reports of any form frequently, it is very likely that you will want them to look the same every time and hence you will want to define the report settings once in the configuration file.Hooks: one of the reasons for using Lua-based configuration files was to allow providing extra customization abilities to the user. Kyua could theoretically call back into Lua code to perform particular actions, and such actions could be explicitly stated by the user in the form of Lua functions. Neither the current configuration code nor Kyua has support for hooks, but the new implementation makes it rather easy to add them.And that's all for today. Now that you know what the current code is trying to achieve and why, we will be able to look at how the implementation does all this in the next posts.</p><p class=text-muted>May 28, 2012

The requirements for the configuration were minimal, as there were very few parameters to be exposed to the user. The implementation was quick and simple to allow further progress on other more-important parts of the project. (Yep, quick is an euphemism for dirty: the implementation of the "configuration class" has to special-case properties everywhere to deal with their particular types... just as the Lua script has to do too.)
As I just mentioned in the previous paragraph, the set of parameters exposed through the configuration file were minimal. Let's recap what these are:Run-time variables: architecture and platform, which are two strings identifying the system; and unprivileged_user, which (if defined) is the name of the user under which to run unprivileged tests as. It is important to mention that the unprivileged_user is internally represented by a data type that includes several properties about a system user, and that it ensures that the data it contains is valid at all times. The fact that every property holds a specific type is an important design requirement.Test suite variables: every test suite can accept arbitrary configuration variables. Actually, these are defined by the test programs themselves. All of these properties are strings (and cannot be anything else because ATF test programs have no way of indicating the type of the configuration variables they accept/expect).Because of the reduced set of configurable properties, I opted to implement the configuration of the program as a simple data structure with one field per property, and a map of properties to represent the arbitrary test suite variables. The "parser" to populate this structure consists on a Lua module that loads these properties from a Lua script. The module hooks into the Lua metatables to permit things like "test_suites.NetBSD.timeout=20" to work without having to predeclare the intermediate tables.
Unfortunately, as I keep adding more and more functionality to Kyua, I encounter additional places where a tunable would be appreciated by the end user (e.g. "disallow automatic line wrapping"). Exposing such tunable through a command-line flag would be a possibility, but some of these need to be permanent in order to be useful. It is clear that these properties have to be placed in the configuration file, and attempting to add them to the current codebase shows that the current abstractions in Kyua are not flexible enough.
So, why am I saying all this? Well: during the last few weeks, I have been working on a new configuration module for Kyua. The goals have been simple:Have a generic configuration module that parses configuration files only, without any semantics about Kyua (e.g. what variables are valid or not). This ensures that the implementation is extensible and at the right level of abstraction.Be able to get rid of the ad-hoc parsing of configuration files.Allow defining properties in a strictly-typed tree structure. Think about being able to group properties by function, e.g. "kyua.host.architecture"; this is more or less what we have today for test-suite properties but the implementation is a special-case again and cannot be applied to other tunables.And... I am pleased to say that this code is about to get merged into the tree just in time for Kyua 0.4. In the next few posts, I will explain what the particular design constraints of this new configuration system were and outline a little bit its implementation. I think it's a pretty cool hack that mixes C++ data structures and Lua scripts in a "transparent" manner, albeit you may think it's too &nbsp;complex. The key part is that, as this new configuration module is not specific to Kyua, you might want to borrow the code/ideas for your own use!</p><p class=text-muted>May 26, 2012

With RAII, you can wrap non-stack-managed resources into a stack-managed object such that, when the stack-managed object goes out of scope, it releases the corresponding non-stack-managed object. Smart pointers are just one example of this technique, but so are IO streams too.
Before getting into the point of the article, bear with me for a second while I explain what the&nbsp; stack_cleaner object of Lutok is. The "stack cleaner" takes a reference to a Lua state and records the height of the Lua stack on creation. When the object is destroyed (which happens when the declaring function exits), the stack is returned to its previous height thus ensuring it is clean. It is always a good idea for a function to prevent side-effects by leaving its outside world as it was â€” and, like it or not, the Lua state is part of the outside world because it is an input/output parameter to many functions.
Let's consider a piece of code without using the stack cleaner:
void
my_function(lutok::state& state, const int foo)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state.push_integer(foo);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... do something else in the state ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const int bar = state.to_integer();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (bar != 3) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; state.pop(1); &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throw std::runtime_error("Invalid data!");
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; state.pop(1);
}
Note that we have had to call state.pop(1) from "all" exit points of the function to ensure that the stack is left unmodified upon return of my_function. Also note that "all exit points" may not be accurate: in a language that supports exceptions, any statement may potentially raise an exception so to be really safe we should do:
void
my_function(lutok::state& state, const int foo)
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state.push_integer(foo);
&nbsp; &nbsp; try { &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; ... do something else in the state ...
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; const int bar = state.to_integer();
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; if (bar != 3 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throw std::runtime_error("Invalid data!");
&nbsp; &nbsp; } catch (...) {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; state.pop(1);
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throw;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state.pop(1);
}
... which gets old very quickly. Writing this kind of code is error-prone and boring.
With an "auto-cleaner" object such as the stack_cleaner, we can simplify our code like this:
void
my_function(lutok::state& state, const int foo)
{
&nbsp; &nbsp; lutok::stack_cleaner cleaner(state);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; state.push_integer(foo);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... do something else in the state ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const int bar = state.to_integer();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (bar != 3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; throw std::runtime_error("Invalid data!"); }
And we leave the boring task of determining when to actually call state.pop(1) to the compiler and the runtime environment. In this particular case, no matter how the my_function terminates, we ensure that the Lua stack will be left as the same size as it was before.
But, as I said earlier, all this was just an introduction to the idea that made me write this post.
When you declare an auto-cleaner object of any kind, be sure to give it a name. It has happened to me a few times already that I have written the following construct:
lutok::stack_cleaner(state);
... which is syntactically correct, harmless and "looks good" if you don't look closely. The compiler will chew along just fine because, even though we are declaring an anonymous object, its constructor and destructor may be doing who-knows-what, so their code must be called and thus the "unused variable" warning cannot really be raised.
However this does not give us the desired behavior. The cleaner object will be constructed and destructed in the same statement without having a chance to wrap any of the following code, because its scope is just the statement in which it was defined. In other words, the cleaner will have absolutely no effect on the rest of the function and thus will be useless.
So, moral of the story: always give a name to your auto-cleaner objects so that their scope is correctly defined and their destructor is run when you actually expect:
lutok::stack_cleaner ANY_NAME_HERE(state);</p><p class=text-muted>September 17, 2011

Lutok is the result of what was promised in the "Splitting utils::lua from Kyua" web post.
Quoting the project web page:
Lutok provides thin C++ wrappers around the Lua C API to ease the interaction between C++ and Lua. These wrappers make intensive use of RAII to prevent resource leakage, expose C++-friendly data types, report errors by means of exceptions and ensure that the Lua stack is always left untouched in the face of errors. The library also provides a small subset of miscellaneous utility functions built on top of the wrappers.
Lutok focuses on providing a clean and safe C++ interface; the drawback is that it is not suitable for performance-critical environments. In order to implement error-safe C++ wrappers on top of a Lua C binary library, Lutok adds several layers or abstraction and error checking that go against the original spirit of the Lua C API and thus degrade performance.
Lutok was originally developed within Kyua but was later split into its own project to make it available to general developers.Coming up with a name for this project was quite an odyssey, and is what has delayed is release more than I wanted. My original candidate was "luawrap" which, although not very original, was to-the-point and easy to understand. Unfortunately, that name did not clear with the legal department and I had to propose several other names, some of which were not acceptable either. Eventually, I settled with "Lutok", which comes from "LUa TOolKit".
At this point, the source tree of Lutok provides pretty much the same code as the utils::lua module of Kyua. While it may be enough to get you started, I'm pretty sure you will lack some functions in the state class. If that is the case, don't hesitate to file a bug report to let me know what is missing.
In case you missed the link above, the project page is here: Lutok in Google Code.</p><p class=text-muted>September 15, 2011

You can take a look at the current code as of r129.
Quoting the previous post:
The utils::lua library provides thin C++ wrappers around the Lua C API to ease the interaction between C++ and Lua. These wrappers make intensive use of RAII to prevent resource leakage, expose C++-friendly data types, report errors by means of exceptions and ensure that the Lua stack is always left untouched in the face of errors. The library also provides a place (the operations module) to add miscellaneous utility functions built on top of the wrappers.While the RAII wrappers and other C++-specific constructions are a very nice thing to have, this library has to jump through a lot of hoops to interact with binary Lua versions built for C. This makes utils::lua not usable for performance-critical environments. Things would be way easier if utils::lua linked to a Lua binary built for C++, but unfortunately that is not viable in most, if not all, systems with binary packaging systems (read: most Linux distributions, BSD systems, etc.).
That said, I've had requests from a bunch of people to provide utils::lua separately from Kyua regardless of any performance shortcomings it may have, and this is what I have started doing this weekend. So far, I already have a pretty clumsy standalone package (I'll keep the name to myself for now ;-) that provides this library on its own with the traditional Automake, Autoconf and Libtool support. Once this is a bit better quality, and once I modify Kyua to link against this external library and assess that things work fine, I'll make the decision on how to publish this (but most likely it should be a separate project in Google Code).
Splitting the code doesn't come with its own issues though: maintaining a separate package will involve more work and hopefully/supposedly, dealing with quite a few feature requests to add missing functionality! Also, it means that utils::lua cannot use any of the other Kyua libraries (utils::sanity for example), so I lose a bit of consistency across the Kyua codebase. I am also not sure about how to share non-library code (in particular, the m4 macros for Autoconf) across the two packages.
So, my question is: are you interested in utils::lua being shipped separately? :-)&nbsp; Do you have any cool use cases for it that you can share here?
Thanks!</p><p class=text-muted>September 3, 2011

This class completely hides the internal C type of Lua to ensure that all calls that affect the state go through the lua::state class.
Things get a bit messy when we want to inject native functions into the Lua environment. These functions follow the prototype represented by the lua_CFunction type:typedef int (*lua_CFunction)(lua_State*);Now, let's consider this code:int
awesome_native_function(lua_State* state)
{
// Uh, we have access to s, so we bypass the lua::state!
... do something nasty ...
// Oh, and we can throw an exception here...
//with bad consequences.
}
void
setup(...)
{
lua::state state;
state.push_c_function(awesome_native_function);
state.set_global("myfunc");
... run some script ...
}The fact that we must pass a lua_CFunction prototype to the lua_pushcfunction object means that such function must have access to the raw lua_State* pointer... which we want to avoid.
What we really want is the caller code to define a function such as:typedef int (*cxx_function)(lua::state&)In an ideal world, the lua::state class would implement a push_cxx_function that took a cxx_function, generated a thin C wrapper and injected such generated wrapper into Lua. Unfortunately, we are not in an ideal world: C++ does not have high-order functions and thus the "generate a wrapper function" part of the previous proposal does not really work.
What we can do instead, though, is to make the creation of C wrappers for these C++ functions trivial. And this is what r42 did. The approach I took is similar to this overly-simplified (and broken) example:template&lt; cxx_function Function >
int
wrap_cxx_function(lua_State* state)
{
try {
lua::state state_wrapper(state);
return Function(state_wrapper);
} catch (...) {
luaL_error(state, "Geez, don't go into C's land!");
}
}This template wrapper takes a cxx_function object and generates a corresponding C function at compile time. This wrapper function ensures that C++ state does not propagate into the C world, as that often has catastrophical consequences. (Due to language limitations, the input function must have external linkage. So no, it cannot be static.)
As a result, we can rewrite our original snippet as:int
awesome_native_function(lua::state& state)
{
// See, we cannot access lua_State* now.
... do something ...
throw std::runtime_error("And we can even do this!");
}
void
setup(...)
{
lua::state state;
state.push_c_function(
wrap_cxx_function< awesome_native_function >);
state.set_global("myfunc");
... run some script ...
}Neat? I think so, but maybe not so much. I'm pretty sure there are cooler ways of achieving the above purpose in a cleaner way, but this one works nicely and has few overhead.</p><p class=text-muted>January 17, 2011

Later, I announced the new C++ interface for Lua implemented within Kyua. And today, I would like to talk about the specific mechanism I implemented in this library to deal with the Lua errors.
The first thing to keep in mind is that the whole purpose of Lua in the context of Kyua is to parse configuration files. This is an infrequent operation, so high performance does not matter: it is more valuable to me to be able to write robust algorithms fast than to have them run at optimal speed. The other key point to consider is that I want Kyua to be able to use prebuilt Lua libraries, which are built as C binaries.
The approach I took is to wrap every single unsafe Lua C API call in a "thin" (FSVO thin depending on the case) wrapper that gets called by lua_pcall. Anything that runs inside the wrapper is safe to Lua errors, as they are caught and safely reported to the caller.
Lets examine how this works by taking a look at an example: the wrapping of lua_getglobal. We have the following code (copy pasted from the utils/lua/wrap.cpp file but hand-edited for publishing here):static int
protected_getglobal(lua_State* state)
{
lua_getglobal(state, lua_tostring(state, -1));
return 1;
}
void
lua::state::get_global(const std::string& name)
{
lua_pushcfunction(_pimpl->lua_state, protected_getglobal);
lua_pushstring(_pimpl->lua_state, name.c_str());
if (lua_pcall(_pimpl->lua_state, 1, 1, 0) != 0)
throw lua::api_error::from_stack(_pimpl->lua_state,
"lua_getglobal");
}The state::get_global method is my public wrapper for the lua_getglobal Lua C API call. This wrapper first prepares the Lua stack by pushing the address of the C function to call and its parameters and then issues a lua_pcall call that executes the C function in a Lua protected environment.
In this case, the argument preparation for protected_getglobal is trivial because the lua_getglobal call does not require access to any preexisting values on the Lua stack. Things get much trickier when that happens as in the case of the lua_getglobal wrapper. I'll leave understanding how to do this as an exercise to the reader (but you can cheat by looking at line 154).
Anyway. The above looks all very nice and safe and the tests for the state::get_global function, even the ones that intentionally cause a failure, all work fine. So we are good, right? Nope! Unfortunately, the code above is not fully safe to Lua errors.
In order to prepare the lua_pcall execution, the code must push values on the stack. As it turns out, both lua_pushcfunction and lua_pushstring can fail if they run out of memory (OOM). Such failure would of course be captured inside a protected environment... but we have a little chicken'n'egg problem here. That said, OOM failures are rare so I'm going to leverage this fact and not worry about it. (Note to self: install a lua_atpanic handler to complain loudly if that ever happens.)
Addendum: Bundling Lua within my program and building it as a C++ binary with exception reporting enabled in luaconf.h would magically solve all my issues. I know. But I don't fancy the idea of bundling the library into my source tree for a variety of reasons.</p><p class=text-muted>January 14, 2011

After two weeks of holidays work, I have finally been able to submit Kyua's r39: a generic library that implements a C++ interface to Lua. The code is hosted in the utils/lua/ subdirectory.
From the revision description:The utils::lua library provides thin C++ wrappers around the Lua C API to ease the interaction between C++ and Lua. These wrappers make intensive use of RAII to prevent resource leakage, expose C++-friendly data types, report errors by means of exceptions and ensure that the Lua stack is always left untouched in the face of errors.

Further changes to Kyua to implement the new configuration system will follow soon as all the basic code to talk to Lua has been ironed out. Also expect some extra posts regarding the design decisions that went on this helper code and, in particular, about error reporting as mentioned in the previous post.
(Yep, Lua and Kyua sound similar. But that was never intended; promise!)</p><p class=text-muted>January 8, 2011

To get an initial idea on what these are, take a look at the Functions and Types section and pay attention to the third field of a function description (the one denoted by 'x' in the introduction).
Dealing with the errors raised by these functions is tricky, not to say a nightmare. Also, the ridiculously-short documentation on this topic does not help. This post is dedicated to explain how these errors may be handled along with the advantages and disadvantages of each case.
The Lua C API provides two modes of execution: protected and unprotected. When in protected mode, all errors caused by Lua are caught and reported to the caller in a controlled manner. When in unprotected mode, the errors just abort the execution of the calling process by default. So, one would think: just run the code in protected mode, right? Yeah, well... entering protected mode is nontrivial and it has its own particularities that make interaction with C++ problematic.
Let's analyze error reporting by considering a simple example: the lua_gettable function. The following Lua code would error out when executed:my_array = nil
return my_array["test"]... which is obvious because indexing a non-table object is a mistake. Now let's consider how this code would look like in C (modulo the my_array assignment):lua_getglobal(state, "my_array");
lua_pushstring(state, "test");
lua_gettable(state, -2);Simple, huh? Sure, but as it turns out, any of the API calls (not just lua_gettable) in this code can raise errors (I'll call them unsafe functions). What this means is that, unless you run the code with a lua_pcall wrapper, your program will simply exit in the face of a Lua error. Uh, your scripting language can "crash" your host program out of your control? Not nice.
What would be nice is if each of the Lua C API unsafe functions reported an error (as a return value or whatever) and allowed the caller to decide what to do. Ideally, no state would change in the face of an error. Unfortunately, that is not the case but it is exactly what I would like to do. I am writing a C++ wrapper for Lua in the context of Kyua and fine granularity in error reporting means that automatic cleanup of resources managed by RAII is trivial.
Let's analyze the options that we have to control errors caused within the Lua C API. I will explain in a later post the one I have chosen for the wrapper in Kyua (it has to be later because I'm not settled yet!).
Install a panic handler
Whenever Lua code runs in an unprotected environment, one can use lua_atpanic to install a handler for errors. The function provided by the user is executed when the error occurs and, if the panic function returns, the program exits. To prevent exiting prematurely, one could opt for two mechanisms:
Make the panic handler raise a C++ exception. Sounds nice, right? Well, it does not work. The Lua library is generally built as a C binary which means that our panic handler will be called from within a C environment. As a result, we cannot throw an exception from our C++ handler and expect things to work: the exception won't propagate correctly from a C++ context to a C context and then back to C++. Most likely, the program will abort as soon as we leave the C++ world and enter C to unwind the stack.Use setjmp before the call to the unsafe Lua function and recover with longjmp from within the panic handler. It turns out that this does work but with one important caveat: the stack is completely cleared before the call to the panic handler. As a result, this prevents the requirement of "leave the stack unmodified on failure" as is desired of any function (report errors early before changing state).Run every single call in a protected environment
This is doable but complex and not completely right: to do this, we need to write a C wrapper function for every unsafe API function and run it with lua_pcall. The overhead of this approach is significant: something as simple as a call to lua_gettable turns into several stack manipulation operations, a call to lua_pcall and then further stack modifications to adjust the results.
Additionally, in order to prepare the call to lua_pcall, one has to use the multiple lua_push* functions to prepare the stack for the call. And, guess what, most of these functions that push values onto the stack can themselves fail. So... in order to prepare the environment for a safe call, we are already executing unsafe calls. (Granted, the errors in these case are only due to memory exhaustion... but still, the solution is not fully robust.)
Lastly, note that we cannot use lua_cpcall because it does discard all return values of the executed function. Which means that we can't really wrap single Lua operations. (We could wrap a whole algorithm though.)
Run the whole algorithm in a protected environment
This defeats the whole purpose of the per-function wrapping. We would need to provide a separate C/C++ function that runs all unsafe code and then call it by means of lua_pcall (or lua_cpcall) so that errors are captured and reported in a controlled manner. This seems very efficient... albeit not transparent and will surely cause issues.
Why is this problematic? Errors that happen inside the protected environment are managed by means of a longjmp. If the code wrapped by lua_pcall is a C++ function, it can instantiate objects. These objects have destructors. A longjmp outside of the function means that no destructors will run... so objects will leak memory, file descriptors, and anything you can imagine. Doom's day.
Yes, I know Lua can be rebuilt to report internal errors by means of exceptions which would make this particular problem a non-issue... but this rules out any pre-packaged Lua binaries (the default is to use longjmp and henceforth what packaged binaries use). I do not want to embed Lua into my source tree. I want to use Lua binary packages shipped with pretty much any OS (hey, including NetBSD!), which means that my code needs to be able to cope with Lua binaries that use setjmp/longjmp internally.
Closing remarks
I hope the above description makes any sense because I had to omit many, many details in order to make the post reasonably short. It could also be that there are other alternatives I have not considered, in which case I'd love to know them. Trying to find a solution to the above problem has already sucked several days of my free time, which translates in Kyua not seeing any further development until a solution is found!</p><p class=text-muted>January 7, 2011

The main purpose of this auxiliary library is to ensure that global interpreter resources such as the global state or the execution stack are kept consistent in the presence of exceptions &mdash; and, in particular, that none of these are leaked due to programming mistakes when handling error codes.
To illustrate this point, let's forget about Lua and consider a simpler case. Suppose we lost the ability to pass arguments and return values from functions in C++ and all we have is a stack that we pass around. With this in mind, we could implement a multiply function as follows:void multiply(std::stack< int >& context) {
const int arg1 = context.top();
context.pop();
const int arg2 = context.top();
context.pop();
context.push(arg1 * arg2);
}And we could call our function as this:std::stack< int > context;
context.push(5);
context.push(6);
multiply(context);
const int result = s.top();
s.pop();In fact, my friends, this is more-or-less what your C/C++ compiler is internally doing when converting code to assembly language. The way the stack is organized to perform calls is known as the calling conventions of an ABI (language/platform combination).
Anyway, back to our point. One important property of such a stack-based system is that any function that deals with the stack must leave it in a consistent state: if the function pushes temporary values (read: local variables) into the stack, such temporary values must be gone upon return no matter how the function terminates. Otherwise, the caller will not find the stack as it expects, which will surely cause trouble at a later stage. The above example works just fine because our function is extremely simple and does not put anything on the stack.
But things get messier when our functions can fail halfway through, and, in particular, if such failures are signaled by exceptions. In these cases, the function will abort abruptly and the function must take care to clean up any values that may still be left on the stack. Let's consider another example:void magic(std::stack< int >& context) {
const int arg1 = context.top();
context.pop();
const int arg2 = context.top();
context.pop();
context.push(arg1 * arg2);
context.push(arg1 / arg2);
try {
... do something with the two values on top ...
context.push(arg1 - arg2);
try {
... do something with the three values on top ...
} catch (...) {
context.pop(); // arg1 - arg2
throw;
}
context.pop();
} catch (...) {
context.pop(); // arg1 / arg2
context.pop(); // arg1 * arg2
throw;
}
context.pop();
context.pop();
}The above is a completely fictitious and useless function, but serves to illustrate the point. magic() starts by pushing two values on the stack and then performs some computation that reads these two values. It later pushes an additional value and does some more computations on the three temporary values that are on the top of the stack.
The "problem" is that the computation code can throw an exception. If it does, we must sanitize the stack to remove the two or three values we have already pushed. Otherwise, the caller will receive the exception, it will assume nothing has happened, and will leak values on the stack (bad thing). To prevent this, we have added a couple of try/catch clauses to capture these possible exceptions and to clean up the already-pushed values before exiting the function. Unfortunately, this gets old very quickly: having to add try/catch statements surrounding every call is boring, ugly, and hard to read (remember that, potentially, any statement can throw an exception). You can see this in the example above with the two nested try/catch blocks.
To mitigate this situation, we can apply a RAII-like technique to make popping elements on errors completely transparent and automated. If we can make it transparent, writing the code is easier and reading it is trivial; if we can make it automated, we can be certain that our error paths (rarely tested!) correctly clean up any global state. In C++, destructors are deterministically executed whenever a variable goes out of scope, so we can use this to our advantage to clean up temporary values. Let's consider this class:class temp_stack {
std::stack< int >& _stack;
int _pop_count;
public:
temp_stack(std::stack< int >& stack_) :
_stack(stack_), _pop_count(0) {}
~temp_stack(void)
{
while (_pop_count-- > 0)
_stack.pop();
}
void push(int i)
{
_stack.push(i);
_pop_count++;
}
};With this, we can rewrite our function as:void magic(std::stack< int >& context) {
const int arg1 = context.top();
context.pop();
const int arg2 = context.top();
context.pop();
temp_stack temp(context);
temp_stack.push(arg1 * arg2);
temp_stack.push(arg1 / arg2);
... do something with the two values on top ...
temp_stack.push(arg1 - arg2);
... do something with the three values on top ...
// Yes, we can return now. No need to do manual pop()s!
}Simple, huh? Our temp_stack function keeps track of how many elements have been pushed on the stack. Whenever the function terminates, be it due to reaching the end of the body or due to an exception thrown anywhere, the temp_stack destructor will remove all elements previously registered from the stack. This ensures that the function leaves the global state (the stack) as it was on entry &mdash; modulo the function parameters consumed as part of the calling conventions.
So how does all this play together with Lua? Well, Lua maintains a stack to communicate parameters and return values between C and Lua. Such stack can be managed in a similar way with a RAII class, which makes it very easy to write native functions that deal with the stack and clean it up correctly in all cases. I would like to show you some non-fictitious code right now, but it's not ready yet ;-) But when it is, it will be part of Kyua. Stay tuned!
And, to conclude: to make C++ code robust, wrap objects that need manual clean up (pointers, file descriptors, etc.) with small wrapper classes that perform such clean up on destruction. These classes are typically fully inlined and contain a single member field, so they do not impose any performance penalty. But, on the contrary, your code can avoid the need of many try/catch blocks, which are tricky to get right and hard to validate. (Unfortunately, this technique cannot be applied in, e.g. Java or Python, because the execution of the class destructors is completely non-deterministic and not guaranteed to happen whatsoever!)</p><p class=text-muted>December 27, 2010

This tool has to support two modes: one to generate a single trace for the whole application and one to generate one trace per parallel region of the application.
In the initial versions of my rewrite, I followed the idea of the previous version of the tool: have a -split flag in the frontend that enables or disables the behavior described above. This flag was backed by an abstract class, Tracer, and two implementations: PlainTracer and SplittedTracer. The thread-initialization callback of the tool then allocated one of these objects for every new thread and the per-instruction injected code used a pointer to the interface to call the appropriate specialized instrumentation routine. This pretty much looked like this:void
thread_start_callback(int tid, ...)
{
if (splitting)
tracers[tid] = new SplittedTracer();
else
tracers[tid] = new PlainTracer();
}
void
per_instruction_callback(...)
{
Tracer* t = tracers[PIN_ThreadId()];
t->instruction_callback(...);
}I knew from the very beginning that such an implementation was going to be inefficient due to the pointer dereference at each instruction and the vtable lookup for the correct virtual method implementation. However, it was a very quick way to move forward because I could reuse some small parts of the old implementation.
There were two ways to optimize this: the first one involved writing different versions of per_instruction_callback, one for plain tracing and the other for splitted tracing, and then deciding which one to insert depending on the flag. The other way was to use template metaprogramming.
As you can imagine, this being C++, I opted to use template metaprogramming to heavily abstract the code in the Pin tool. Now, I have an abstract core parametrized on the Tracer type. When instantiated, I provide the correct Tracer class and the compiler does all the magic for me. With this design, there is no need to have a parent Tracer class &mdash; though I'd welcome having C++0x concepts available &mdash;, and the callbacks can be easily inlined because there is no run-time vtable lookup. It looks something like this:template< class Tracer >
class BasicTool {
Tracer* tracers[MAX_THREADS];
Tracer* allocate_tracer(void) const = 0;
public:
Tracer*
get_tracer(int tid)
{
return tracers[tid];
}
};
class PlainTool : public BasicTool< PlainTracer > {
PlainTracer*
allocate_tracer(void) const
{
return new PlainTracer();
}
public:
...
} the_plain_tool;
// This is tool-specific, non-templated yet.
void
per_instruction_callback(...)
{
the_plain_tool.get_tracer(PIN_ThreadId()).instruction_callback(...);
}What this design also does is force me to have two different Pin tools: one for plain tracing and another one for splitted tracing. Of course, I chose it to be this way because I'm not a fan of run-time options (the -split flag). Having two separate tools with well-defined, non-optional features makes testing much, much easier and... follows the Unix philosophy of having each tool do exactly one thing, but doing it right!
Result: around a 15% speedup. And C++ was supposed to be slow? ;-) You just need to know what the language provides you and choose wisely. (Read: my initial, naive prototype had a run-time of 10 minutes to trace part of a small benchmark; after several rounds of optimizations, it's down to 1 minute and 50 seconds to trace the whole benchmark!)
Disclaimer: The code above is an oversimplification of what the tool contains. It is completely fictitious and obviates many details. I will admit, though, that the real code is too complex at the moment. I'm looking for ways to simplify it.</p><p class=text-muted>May 7, 2009

Here is how.
In C, when you need to check for the limits of native numeric types, such as int or unsigned long, you include the limits.h header file and then use the INT_MIN/INT_MAX and ULONG_MAX macros respectively. In the C++ world, there is a corresponding climits header file to get the definition of these macros, so I always thought this was the way to follow.
However, it turns out that the C++ standard defines a limits header file too, which provides the numeric_limits&lt;T> template. This template class is specialized in T for every numeric type and provides a set of static methods to query properties about the corresponding type. The simplest ones are min() and max(), which are what we need to replace the old-style *_MIN and *_MAX macros.
As an example, this C code:#include &lt;limits.h>
#include &lt;stdio.h>
#include &lt;stdlib.h>
int
main(void)
{
printf("Integer range: %d to %dn", INT_MIN, INT_MAX);
return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}becomes the following in C++:#include &lt;cstdlib>
#include &lt;iostream>
#include &lt;limits>
int
main(void)
{
std::cout &lt;&lt; "Integer range: "
&lt;&lt; std::numeric_limits&lt; int &gt::min()
&lt;&lt; " to "
&lt;&lt; std::numeric_limits&lt; int &gt::max()
&lt;&lt; "n";
return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}Check out the documentation for more details on additional methods!</p><p class=text-muted>May 4, 2009

class something {
...
};
} // namespaceUntil now.
Not using unnamed namespaces in my own code bit me with name clash errors. How? Take ATF. Some of its files declare classes in .cpp files (not headers). I just copy/pasted some ATF code in another project and linked the libraries produced by each project together. Boom! Link error because of duplicate symbols. And the linker is quite right in saying so!
For some reason, I always assumed that classes declared in the .cpp files would be private to the module. But if you just think a little bit about it, just a little, this cannot ever be the case: how could the compiler tell the difference between a class definition in a header file and a class definition in a source file? The compiler sees preprocessed sources, not what the programmer wrote, so all class definitions look the same!
So how do you resolve this problem? Can you have a static class, pretty much like you can have a static variable or function? No, you cannot. Then, how do you declare implementation-specific classes private to a module? Put them in an unnamed namespace as the code above shows and you are all set. Every translation unit has its own unnamed namespace and everything you put in it will not conflict with any other translation unit.</p><p class=text-muted>March 23, 2009

However, the way I wrote these tests was a hack since the first day: I use automake to generate a temporary library that builds small source files, each one including one of the public header files. This approach works but has two drawbacks. First, if you do not have the source tree, you cannot reproduce these tests -- and one of ATF's major features is the ability to install tests and reproduce them even if you install from binaries, remember? And second, it's not reusable: I now find myself needing to do this exact same thing in another project... what if I could just use ATF for it?
Even if the above were not an issue, build-time checks are a nice thing to have in virtually every project that installs libraries. You need to make sure that the installed library is linkable to new source code and, currently, there is no easy way to do this. As a matter of fact, the NetBSD tree has such tests and they haven't been migrated to ATF for a reason.
I'm trying to implement this in ATF at the moment. However, running the compiler in a transparent way is a tricky thing. Which compiler do you execute? Which flags do you need to pass? How do you provide a portable-enough interface for the callers?
The approach I have in mind involves caching the same compiler and flags used to build ATF itself and using those as defaults anywhere ATF needs to run the compiler itself. Then, make ATF provide some helper check functions that call the compiler for specific purposes and hide all the required logic inside them. That should work, I expect. Any better ideas?</p><p class=text-muted>March 5, 2009

I was recently given some C++ code to rewrite^Wclean up and one of the things I did not like was a macro called DPRINT alongside with its use of fprintf. Why? First because this is C++, so you should be using iostreams. Second because by using iostreams you do not have to think about the correct printf-formatter for every type you need to print. And third because it obviously relied on the preprocessor and, how not, debug builds were already broken.
I wanted to come up with an approach to print debug messages that involved the preprocessor as less as possible. This application (a simulator) needs to be extremely efficient in non-debug builds, so leaving calls to printf all around that internally translated to noops at runtime wasn't a nice option because some serious overhead would still be left. So, if you don't use the preprocessor, how can you achieve this? Simple: current compilers have very good optimizers so you can rely on them to do the right thing for release builds.
The approach I use is as follows: I define a custom debug_stream class that contains a reference to a std::ostream object. Then, I provide a custom operator&lt;&lt; that delegates the insertion to the output stream. Here is the only place where the preprocessor is involved: a small conditional is used to omit the delegation in release builds:template&lt; typename T >
inline
debug_stream&
operator<<(debug_stream& d, const T& t)
{
#if !defined(NDEBUG)
d.get() &lt;&lt; t;
#endif // !defined(NDEBUG)
return d;
}There is also a global instance of a debug_stream called debug. With this in mind, I can later print debugging messages anywhere in the code as follows:debug << "This is a debug message!n";So how does this not introduce any overhead in release builds?
In release builds, operator&lt;&lt; is effectively a noop. It does nothing. As long as the compiler can determine this, it will strip out the calls to the insertion operator.
But there is an important caveat. This approach requires you to be extremely careful in what you insert in the stream. Any object you construct as part of the insertion or any function you call may have side effects. Therefore, the compiler must generate the call to the code anyway because it cannot predict what its effects will be. How do you avoid that? There are two approaches. The first one involves defining everything involved in the debug call as inline or static; the trick is to make the compiler see all the code involved and thus be able to strip it out after seeing it has no side effects. The second approach is simply to avoid such object constructions or function calls completely. Debug-specific code should not have side effects, or otherwise you risk having different application behavior in debug and release builds! Not nice at all.
A last note: the above is just a proof of concept. The code we have right now is more complex than what I showed above as it supports debug classes, the selection of which classes to print at runtime and prefixes every line with the class name. All of this requires several inline magic to get things right but it seems to be working just fine now :-)
So, the conclusion: in most situations, you do not need to use the preprocessor. Find a way around it and your developers will be happier. Really.</p><p class=text-muted>March 2, 2009

So here goes another one based on a problem a friend has found at work today. I hope to reproduce the main idea behind the problem correctly, but my memory is a bit fuzzy.
Can you guess why the following program fails to compile due to an error in the call to equals from within main? Bonus points if you don't build it.struct data {
int field;
};
template< typename Data >
class base {
public:
virtual ~base(void)
{
}
virtual bool equals(const Data& a,
const Data& b) const
{
return a == b;
}
};
class child : public base< data > {
public:
bool equals(const data& a,
const data& b) const
{
return a.field == b.field;
}
};
int
main(void)
{
data d1, d2;
base< data >* c = new child();
(void)c->equals(d1, d2);
delete c;
return 0;
}Tip: If you make base::equals a pure abstract method, the code builds fine.</p><p class=text-muted>October 22, 2008

C++, with its complex and complete syntax, is a very versatile language. Because it supports object-oriented capabilities and has powerful object libraries&mdash;such as the STL or Boost&mdash;one can quickly implement robust, high-level systems. On the other hand, thanks to its C roots, C++ allows the implementation of very low-level code. This has advantages but also carries some disadvantages, especially when one attempts to write high-level applications.</p><p class=text-muted>May 4, 2006
