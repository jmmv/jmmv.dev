      <description>Live from Malta today attending the EuroBSDCon 2013 conference. The conference is over; today was the second and last day and it has just finished.
Hardware and virtualization
One of the three tracks today included a lot of talks on hardware, porting of BSDs to new hardware and virtualization techniques. Of all these, the few talks I attended covered the topics in great detail and proved to be very interesting.</description>

      <title>VirtualBox and port forwarding (and Fusion)</title>

      <description>I have been a VMware Fusion user for a long time and I think I am about to be a VirtualBox convert. Let me explain you my story.
With the release of the Windows 8 Developer Preview, I felt like giving the system a try. Not because I particularly like or care about Windows, but just because I am genuinely curious about operating systems and wanted to check out their new Metro interface.</description>

      <title>Home-made build farm</title>

      <description>I&#39;m about to publish the 0.4 release of ATF. It has been delayed more than I wanted due to the difficulty in getting time-limited test cases working and due to my laziness in testing the final tarball in multiple operating systems (because I knew I&#39;d have to fight portability problems).
But finally, this weekend I have been setting up a rather-automated build farm at home, which is composed so far of 13 systems.</description>

      <title>A request to virtualization software developers</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/01/request-to-virtualization-software.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/01/request-to-virtualization-software.html</guid>
      <description>Here is a request for a feature I have not yet seen in any virtualization application &amp;mdash; used Parallels Desktop 2, VMware Fusion 1.1 and another product I can&#39;t speak of yet &amp;mdash; that I&#39;d love to have. It&#39;d make things so much easier for me... So here is an open request just in case one of the developers of free alternatives (e.g. VirtualBox) reads it and decides to get ahead of the competence by implementing it.</description>

      <title>Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/07/parallels-desktop-and-vmware-fusion.html</link>

      <description>Back in February, I bought a copy of Parallels Desktop 2 and have been a very happy user of it since then. However, when Parallels 3 appeared, I hesitated to pre-order it (even at a very low price) and I did well: after it was released, I tried it on my MacBook Pro and their 3D support is useless for me. I could not play neither Half-Life 2 nor Doom 3 at acceptable speeds, being the former much worse than the latter in this regard.</description>

      <title>Cross-platform development with Parallels</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/04/cross-platform-development-with.html</link>

      <description>These days I&#39;m seizing some of my free time to continue what I did as my SoC 2006 project: the Boost.Process library. There is still a lot of work to be done, but some items are annoying enough to require early attention (well, I can&#39;t speak of &#34;early&#34; because I hadn&#39;t touched the code for months).
Boost.Process aims to be a cross-platform library and currently works under POSIX-based systems (such as Linux, NetBSD or Mac OS X) as well as under Win32 systems.</description>
