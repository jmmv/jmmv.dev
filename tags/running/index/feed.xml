Today, it has been celebrated for the 9th consecutive year with a record in the number of participants: almost 13,000.&lt;br />&lt;br />As I told you a long time ago, &lt;a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2004/10/do-you-run.html">I enjoy running&lt;/a> so I decided to take part in this race. The event started at 10:00 in the morning and lasted a maximum of an hour and 20 minutes.&lt;br />&lt;br />It took me 46'39" to finish it and ended up in the 4156 position; not that bad, considering that I haven't trained running for a while. The breakdown is:&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>Absolute time of arrival: 48'49"&lt;/li>&lt;li>Real time to completion: 46'39"&lt;/li>&lt;li>Absolute position: 4156th (considering the absolute time)&lt;br />&lt;/li>&lt;li>Corrected position: 3857th (considering the real time)&lt;br />&lt;/li>&lt;li>Category and position within it: Male senior, 1917th&lt;/li>&lt;li>Average time per km: 4'40"&lt;/li>&lt;li>Position and time at first checkpoint (2,5km): 5531th, 14'34"&lt;/li>&lt;li>Position and time at second checkpoint (5km): 4973th, 27'02"&lt;/li>&lt;li>Position and time at third checkpoint (7,5km): 4456th, 34'46" &lt;/li>&lt;/ul> It is the first race I run but it has been very enjoyable and exciting. I'm already looking forward to the next one!</description></item></channel></rss>
