This site is now powered by &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo&lt;/a> instead of &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll&lt;/a>. It took me a full week&amp;rsquo;s worth of early mornings to achieve, but the results are great&amp;hellip; internally, that is, because as a reader you should notice no changes other than minor style tweaks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As of today, this site hosts 711 posts totaling 3.4MB of text. The style sheet is based on &lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap&lt;/a> and is built from scratch using SASS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Looking to replace Jekyll</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/02/looking-to-replace-jekyll.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/02/looking-to-replace-jekyll.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Back in &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2015/05/hello-medium.html">May 2015&lt;/a>, I was lured to Medium by its simplicity and growing community, which resulted in me posting a bunch of articles there and enjoying every moment of it. But, eventually, I noticed that &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2016/01/medium-experiment-wrapup.html">I was losing control of my content&lt;/a>. So &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2016/05/homepage-v3.html">a year later&lt;/a>, my experiments to create static homepage resulted in me moving from Blogger and Medium to a &lt;a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll&lt;/a>-managed site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost two years have passed since that migration and I can only count 7 miserable new posts. This ridiculously-low number, unfortunately, doesn&amp;rsquo;t track my willingness to writeâ€”but &lt;strong>the friction to posting has become so high&lt;/strong> that I fear composing new essays.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Medium experiment wrap-up</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2016/01/medium-experiment-wrapup.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2016 22:30:00 -0500</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2016/01/medium-experiment-wrapup.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Eight months ago, &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2015/05/hello-medium.html">I decided to try
Medium&lt;/a> as the platform on which to
post my essays. Over this time I have published a handful of posts in
there&amp;mdash;8, to be precise, which is&amp;hellip; a very shy number&amp;mdash;but the
results have been quite satisfactory: the WYSIWYG composer is excellent,
the analytics tools are simple but to the point, the looks are great, and
the community is nice (though I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to tap into it just yet).
But where have things failed?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"Your English is pretty good!", they said</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/your-english-is-pretty-good-they-said.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/your-english-is-pretty-good-they-said.html</guid><description>&lt;p>As I spend September in Seoul and attend an intensive Korean language course, &lt;strong>my story with English&lt;/strong> comes to mind. This is a story I have told a bunch of times to friends and coworkers and it&amp;rsquo;s time to write it down for posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the title of this post is a verbatim quote of something I have been told many times throughout the years:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>11 years. Next month will mark 11 years since the creation of &lt;a href="http://julipedia.meroh.net/">The Julipedia&lt;/a>, the personal blog that got me started into this writing journey. 11 years that have brought 690 posts (yeah, yeah, not &lt;em>that&lt;/em> many for such a long time).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And after all this time, it finally hit me: personal blogs have lost their original appeal. It is time for a change. But a change to what?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nexus 9, focused writing, and more</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2015/03/nexus-9-focused-writing-and-more.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2015 16:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2015/03/nexus-9-focused-writing-and-more.html</guid><description>&lt;p>About three weeks ago, I got a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/nexus/9/">Nexus 9&lt;/a> and its accompanying &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/nexus_9_keyboard_folio">Folio case+keyboard&lt;/a> at work with the main goal of drive-testing Google's mobile apps.&lt;/p> &lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center; padding: 20px; ">&lt;img style="box-shadow: 3px 3px 10px; border-width: 1; padding: 0;" border="1" src="https://jmmv.dev/images/2015-03-20-P1140898.jpg" />&lt;/div> &lt;p>Being "free" hardware for testing I could not turn it down, but at first I honestly was not sure what to do with it: I already got a Nexus 10 last year and exchanged it soon after for a Nexus 7 because I did not did not like its bulky feeling. The Nexus 7, on the other hand, is the perfect size for reading news, articles, and books, which is basically the only thing I (used to) do with the tablet.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
