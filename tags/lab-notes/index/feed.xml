      <description>I have had a Netgear WNDR3700v2 router for a few years already and I bought this model specifically because I could flash it with the open-source DD-WRT firmware. The reasons remain the same as the ones I had in 2006&amp;mdash;the key ones being: the ability to run a Dnsmasq DNS/DHCP server for my local network; and the ability to update a single Dynamic DNS address so that I can access my home network when I&amp;rsquo;m on the go.</description>

      <title>Configuring Windows for key-based SSH access</title>

      <description>Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 both ship with OpenSSH (server and client). Installing these components is a breeze, but the official documentation to set everything up is either wrong or incomplete. I wanted to set up key-based authentication and this took quite a bit of poking until I figured out all the right knobs. Here are the lab notes from my adventure.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve spent quite a few time last week setting up my old Mac Mini G4 — a PPC 1.2GHz with 1GB of RAM running NetBSD/macppc current — as a &#34;workstation&#34; for the development of Kyua and other tools for NetBSD. Yes, this machine is very slow, but that&#39;s the whole point of the exercise I&#39;m going to narrate below.
I recently got approval from the NetBSD core team to import Kyua into the NetBSD source tree and replace ATF with it.</description>
