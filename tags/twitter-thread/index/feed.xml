Some argue that they are bad practice; others say that peer programming is better. And while these may be true, I want to tell you a story about a case where code reviews worked well!
Meet X: a junior engineer in the Bazel team circa 2018, tasked to implement two features: A and B. As you may know, Google is big into code reviews&amp;mdash;and their tooling for this is awesome; believe me&amp;mdash;so this was the standard process for X to get his code checked in.</description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-11-21-code-review.png" length="134980" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Good performance is not just big O</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/09/performance-is-not-big-o.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2023 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/09/performance-is-not-big-o.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Having a fast and responsive app is orthogonal to &amp;ldquo;knowing your big &lt;i>O&lt;/i>s&amp;rdquo;. Unfortunately, most tech companies over-emphasize algorithms in interviews and downplay systems knowledge, and I believe that&amp;rsquo;s one reason behind sluggish apps and bloated systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this play out repeatedly. Interviewers ask a LeetCode-style coding question, which is then followed by the ritual of discussing time and memory complexity. Candidates ace the answers. But then&amp;hellip; their &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; code suffers from subtle yet impactful performance problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Focusing on big &lt;em>O&lt;/em> complexity rarely matters in most apps. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s important to think about your algorithmic choices, but there are so many more details to worry about that have a direct impact on app performance and responsiveness. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a bunch of them!&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-09-08-speed-bumps-limit.jpg" length="372231" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Fast machines, slow machines</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/06/fast-machines-slow-machines.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2023 06:50:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/06/fast-machines-slow-machines.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, &lt;em>that&lt;/em> was unexpected. I recorded a couple of crappy videos in 5 minutes, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmmv/status/1671670996921896960">posted them on a Twitter thread&lt;/a>, and went viral with 8.8K likes at this point. I really could not have predicted that, given that I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting what-I-believe-is interesting content for years and&amp;hellip; nothing, almost-zero interest. Now that things have cooled down, it&amp;rsquo;s time to stir the pot and elaborate on those thoughts a bit more rationally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To summarize, the Twitter thread shows two videos: one of an old computer running Windows NT 3.51 and one of a new computer running Windows 11. In each video, I opened and closed a command prompt, File Explorer, Notepad, and Paint. You can clearly see how apps on the old computer open up instantly whereas apps on the new computer show significant lag as they load. I questioned how computers are actually getting better when trivial things like this have regressed. And boom, the likes and reshares started coming in. Obviously some people had issues with my claims, but there seems to be an overwhelming majority of people that agree we have a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To open up, I&amp;rsquo;ll stand my ground: latency in modern computer interfaces, with modern OSes and modern applications, is terrible and getting worse. This applies to smartphones as well. At the same time, while UIs were much more responsible on computers of the past, those computers were also awful in many ways: new systems have changed our lives substantially. So, what gives?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Principal engineers should be on-call</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/07/principal-engineers-oncall.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 06:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/07/principal-engineers-oncall.html</guid><description>&lt;p>A recent tweet that caught my attention read: &amp;ldquo;principal engineers should be on-call&amp;rdquo;.
