Well, the answer is: <span style=font-style:italic>everywhere</span>.<br><br>Here are some examples:<br><ul><li>Nautilus monitors all open folders so that it can update their contents whenever the underlying file store changes. Say you are viewing the Documents folder and you save a new Document from within OpenOffice into that folder. You definitely want Nautilus to show it immediately, without having to manually hit Refresh from the menu.</li><li>The trash applet monitors the trash folders and updates its icon from empty to full whenever one of these folders ceases to be non-empty.</li><li>The panel monitors the applications directory to notice when new applications get installed. This allows it to update the Applications menu immediately as soon as a new program gets installed into the system.</li><li>The GTK file open/save dialogs monitor the directory they are viewing for the same reason as Nautilus. (Actually, I'm unsure about this point. My Linux installation is an old Ubuntu 8.04 LTS that does not have GIO, so I can't verify in recent ones. However, this makes perfect sense and if not implemented, it should be!)</li><li>The background switcher control panel monitors the folders containing images to be able to show new installed backgrounds. (I'm not sure about this either. It doesn't happen in my Linux installation, but it also makes sense.)</li><li>Media players such as Rhythmbox and Banshee allow you to point them to a folder containing music and have an option to automatically add music to the library as soon as it pops up in such folder.</li><li>Potentially, any document editor, picture viewer, etc. monitors the documents opened in them so that these applications can notice external notifications to those files. This is useful to prevent overwriting a file with an out-dated in-memory copy. For example: you are taking some notes with GEdit. On a separate terminal window, you quickly edit the notes file with Vim to add a new note. When you go back to GEdit, you want the editor to tell you that the file has changed out of its control and offer you a choice: e.g. reload or ignore?<br></li></ul>And many, many more other situations that I'm surely missing...<br><br>As you can see, it is fairly important to get the file monitoring subsystem working flawlessly. Otherwise, all these tiny details don't work and the end user experience is undermined.</p><p class=text-muted>April 21, 2010

This library provides an interface to asynchronously wait for file system change notifications including the creation, deletion and modification of files.<br><br>The monitoring functionality in GIO is modular: it is backed by different loadable plugins that implement OS-specific functionality. In particular, GIO uses an inotify module in Linux and a <a href=http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/>FAM</a> module everywhere else.<br><br>Up until now, the <tt>devel/glib2</tt> package in pkgsrc provided a build-time option to specify whether to build the GIO FAM plugin or not. Given that this plugin is built as a shared object that is loaded dynamically at run-time, having a build-time option for this is clearly wrong: it gives no choice to those relying on binary packages (e.g. end/new users). Furthermore, it adds a dependency on the ugly-FAM at the very bottom of the huge Gnome dependency chain. (As already stated, FAM is outdated and hard to set up.)<br><br>So, based on this, I've just removed all FAM support from <tt>devel/glib2</tt> altogether and packaged its loadable module as <tt>sysutils/gio-fam</tt>.<br><br>Now waiting for a clean rebuild of the Gnome packages to see if the desktop now works on my machine by avoiding FAM/Gamin.</p><p class=text-muted>April 20, 2010

While NetBSD has surprised me in a good way (I am running it on a Macbook Pro and things like wireless and DRI work), Gnome has not. There are tons of broken things that prevent a smooth user experience.<br><br>One of these broken things is the monitoring of changes in the file system. Actually, this has never worked 100%. But what is this and why does it matter, you ask? Well, file system monitoring is an internal component of the Gnome infrastructure that allows the desktop to receive notifications when files or directories change. This way, if, say, you are viewing the Downloads folder in Nautilus and you start downloading a file from Epiphany into that folder, Nautilus will realize the new file and show it immediately without requiring a manual refresh.<br><br>How to monitor the file system depends on the operating system. There are basically two approaches: polling and asynchronous notifications. Polling is suboptimal because the notifications are usually delayed. Asynchronous notifications are tied to the operating system: Linux provides <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify>inotify</a>, NetBSD provides <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kqueue>kqueue</a> and other systems provide their own APIs.<span style=display:block id=formatbar_Buttons><span class="on down" style=display:block id=formatbar_CreateLink title=Link onmouseover=ButtonHoverOn(this) onmouseout=ButtonHoverOff(this) onmousedown='CheckFormatting(event),FormatbarButton("richeditorframe",this,8),ButtonMouseDown(this)'><img src=/images/2010-04-20-blank.gif alt=Link class=gl_link border=0></span></span><br>In the past, Gnome monitored the file system by a combination of <a href=http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam/>FAM</a>, a system-level service that provides an API to file system monitoring, and GNOME VFS, a high-level layer that hides the interaction with FAM. This approach was good in spirit (client/server separation) but didn't work well:<br><ul><li>FAM is abandoned.<br></li><li>Does not support kqueue out of the box.</li><li>FAM runs as root.<br></li><li>FAM is too hard to set up: it requires rpcbind, an addition to <tt>/etc/services</tt>, a sysctl tweak, and the configuration of a system-level daemon.</li></ul>To solve some of these problems, a drop-in replacement for FAM was started. <a href=http://people.gnome.org/%7Eveillard/gamin/>Gamin</a>, as it is known, still does not fix everything:<br><ul><li>Gamin is abandoned.</li><li>Supports kqueue out of the box, but does not work very well.</li><li>Actually, Gamin itself does not work. Running the tests provided by the distfile in a modern Linux system results in several test failures.<br></li></ul>Anyway. Did you notice the <span style=font-style:italic>abandoned</span> pattern above? This is important: in the new world order, Gnome does not use FAM any more.<br><br>The new structure to monitor files is: the low-level glib library provides the gio module, which has some file system monitoring APIs. The GVFS module provides higher level abstractions to file system management, and relies on gio for file system monitoring. There is no more GNOME VFS any more.<br><br>The <span style=font-style:italic>key</span> point is: gio uses inotify directly; no abstraction layers in between. FAM support is still there for platforms without inotify, but as it is not used in Linux any more, it rots. Linux developers will never experience what it is to have a system that needs to use FAM to get this functionality to work.<br><br>At last, let's look at the status of all this in NetBSD:<br><ul><li>The FAM package was <a href=/2004/10/fam-and-kqueue.html>patched to support kqueue</a>. Although this kinda works, it is not perfect. Also, as mentioned above, FAM is, I'd say, the package with the hardest installation procedure of the whole Gnome platform.<br></li><li>The Gamin packages are nicer than the FAM package regarding their configuration. However, when using Gamin instead of FAM, all sorts of bugs appear in Gnome (it actually gets stuck during startup for me). The breakage of the unit tests does not provide any confidence, and the fact that Gamin is abandoned, the idea of fixing it doesn't make me thrive.</li><li>The glib2 package <span style=font-style:italic>depends</span> on FAM. This is ugly; really ugly. I had to shout WTF when I saw this, seriously.</li><li>Seeing the direction gio/gvfs take, it is obvious that things can only get worse in the future.<br></li></ul>If time permits, I'm planning to work on improving this whole situation. Ideas include:<br><ul><li>Splitting the FAM gio module out of the glib2 package. Ideally, this would happen upstream.</li><li>Implement a gio backend for kqueue.</li><li>Check if the core packages still using gnome-vfs have a more recent version that uses gvfs instead and, if so, update them.<br></li></ul>Can't promise you anything other than, if I get to work on it, I will keep you posted!</p><p class=text-muted>April 20, 2010

A year and two months later, it is time to complain again.<br><br>I am thinking on renewing my MacBook Pro assuming I can sell this one for a good price. The reasons for this are to get slightly better hardware (more disk, better GPU and maybe 4GB of RAM) and software updates. The problem is: if I am able to find a buyer, I will be left without a computer for some days, and that's not a good scenario. I certainly don't want to order the new one without being certain that I will be paid enough for the current one.<br><br>So yesterday I started assembling some old components I had lying around aiming at having an old but functional computer to work with. But today I realized that I also had the PlayStation 3 with Fedora 8 already installed, and that it'd be enough to use as a desktop for a week or so. I had trimmed down the installation to the bare minimum so that it'd boot as fast as possible and to leave free resources for testing Cell-related stuff. But if I wanted to use the PS3 as a desktop, I needed, for example, GNOME.<br><br>Ew. Doing a <tt>yum groupinstall "GNOME Desktop Environment"</tt> took quite a while, and not because of the network connection. But even if we leave that aside, starting the environment was painful. <i>Really</i> painful. And Mono was not there, at all! It is amazing how unusable the desktop is with "only" 256MB of RAM; the machine is constantly going to swap, and the disk being slow does not help either. I still remember the days when 256MB was a lot, and desktop machines were snappy enough with only half of that, or even less.<br><br>OK, so GNOME is a lot for 256MB of RAM. I am now writing this from the PS3 itself running WindowMaker. Which unfortunately does not solve all the problems &mdash; and the biggest one is that it is not a desktop environment. Firefox also requires lots of resources to start, and doing something else in the background still makes the machine use swap. (Note that I have disabled almost all of the system services enabled by default in Fedora, including SELinux.)<br><br>If I finally sell my MBP, this will certainly be enough for a few days... but it's a pity to see how unusable it is. (Yeah, by today's standards, the PS3 is extremely short on RAM, I know, but GNOME used to run quite well with this amount of RAM just a few years ago.)</p><p class=text-muted>February 28, 2008

I liked you at that time. Despite your 1.5 release had slow disk
performance when compared to the other BSDs, I found in you an operating
system that just felt right. You focused on clean and well designed code
among many other goals; sincerely, I didn&rsquo;t come to you looking for
portability because I never had anything else than i386 machines. All
these feelings turned into love after installing and experimenting with
you: the system was minimal, well documented and made sense. As you
know, I soon left FreeBSD and migrated my machines to you.</p></p><p class=text-muted>September 23, 2006

We are quite happy with the current results because the packages are updated very frequently and everything works. Well, <i>almost</i>. There are still several missing details that really hurt the end user experience and need fixing.<br><br>If things continue as have gone until now, we will always be one step (or more!) behind other operating systems such as Linux and FreeBSD. Linux, of course, gets full support from the GNOME developers because they do their daily work on it. FreeBSD, on the other hand, has more people working on the port and therefore have more manpower to resolve all the portability problems; they are doing a nice work.<br><br>In our case, it is clear that we do not have enough manpower to keep up with the huge task that porting GNOME is &mdash; we are <i>very few</i> people working on it. Just consider that GNOME is composed of around 100 packages and that there are new major releases every 6 months (minor ones coming much faster). This updating task imposes a lot of stress on us that prevents us from working on the remaining pending items.<br><br>If we were able to work on all these issues, we could have a fully-functional GNOME Desktop on top of NetBSD. I belive this is a key area to improve NetBSD's visibility: if we had a complete desktop evnrionment, more users could come and use NetBSD for their daily tasks. Eventually, this could attract more developers who would start contributing to the system itself.<br><br>So... I've prepared a <a href=http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/projects.html#gnome>list of GNOME-related projects</a> that details the major items that need to be addressed to have a complete GNOME Desktop installation on top of NetBSD and pkgsrc. I've tried to detail each project as much as possible, explaining the current problem, why solving it could benefit NetBSD and how to get started.<br><br>Should you need more information, I've also written some generic <a href=http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/pkgsrc/gnome.html>guidelines</a> about GNOME packaging and porting. And, of course, you can <a href="mailto:jmmv AT NetBSD DOT org">contact me</a> to get more details and take one of the projects! I'm willing to mentor you to make them success. You can certainly make a difference to the current status of things.<br><br>Let me add that I've have <i>learned a lot</i> about many different areas from my contributions to pkgsrc and NetBSD. You can seize the opportunity to learn new exciting stuff too; don't be shy! Oh... and if GNOME on NetBSD is not of your preference, please see our <a href=http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/projects.html>complete list of proposed projects</a>; I bet you will find something of your interest!</p><p class=text-muted>September 1, 2006

I had to do it to get some work done more easily than on Windows and to be able to keep up with my developer duties.<br><br>After a successful and painless installation, I built and installed Firefox and Windowmaker, both of which come handy from time to time (specially while rebuilding the entire GNOME Desktop). However, launching Firefox under a plain Windowmaker session greeted me with extremely ugly fonts. The GTK interface was OK, but web pages were rendered horribly in general. It was simply unusable.<br><br>At first I thought it had to do with the anti-aliasing configuration, but several attempts to change its details only resulted in worse fonts. The same happened when dealing with DPI settings. So what was happening? It turns out that Firefox was using bitmapped fonts instead of vector ones &mdash; and you know how ugly these look if they are not rendered in their native size.<br><br>Firefox was asking <a href=http://www.fontconfig.org/>Fontconfig</a> (X's font configuration and access library) to provide a font from the Serif family, without caring about which it could be. Fontconfig then provided it with a bitmapped font. (I still don't know why it preferred those over any other.)<br><br>The nice thing is that you can tell Fontconfig how to match generic font names to the fonts you really have. And this effectively means that you can force it to never use bitmapped fonts. All I had to do was to create a custom <tt>local.conf</tt> file in Fontconfig's configuration directory (<tt>/etc/pkg/fontconfig</tt> in my case):<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;<br>&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd"&gt;<br>&lt;fontconfig&gt;<br>&lt;include&gt;conf.d/no-bitmaps.conf&lt;/include&gt;<br>&lt;/fontconfig&gt;</pre>The curious thing is that GNOME seems to take care of this on its own because Firefox uses nice fonts under it even if you do not touch Fontconfig files.<br><br>Oh! Be aware that NetBSD has two Fontconfig installations: one from the native XFree86 installation and one from pkgsrc. These are configured in different directories: <tt>/etc/fonts</tt> and <tt>PKG_SYSCONFDIR/fontconfig</tt> respectively.<br><br>Don't know if this issue also happens in other operating systems if Fontconfig is not manually configured...</p><p class=text-muted>June 25, 2006

You can find more information in the official release page (linked above).<br><br>I am happy to say that this release works fairly well under NetBSD. There are still some rough edges (that is, programs that crash on startup or do not work as expected) but there shouldn't be much regressions from the previous version.

You'd drag files onto it and they were appropriately deleted but, unfortunately, the trash did not update its status to reflect the removed files. If you opened the folder, it appeared empty despite <tt>~/.Trash</tt> contained the deleted files. As you can image this was very annoying as it made the trash near to useless.<br><br>However, and by pure luck, some days ago I noticed that the trash icon showed some files on my machine. For a moment I thought that the problem had been fixed with GNOME 2.14.0. But I was wrong: <tt>~/.Trash</tt> didn't contain the files shown in the trash window; the files were really stored in <tt>/vol/data/.Trash-jmmv</tt>. So why was it picking up the files from one directory but not from the other one?<br><br>I started by looking for the <tt>.Trash</tt> string in gnome-vfs which led me to a piece of code that returns the trash directory for a given volume. I first thought that there could be a problem detecting the home directory so I added some debugging messages there; everything looked correctly.<br><br>After digging some more and thanks to the <tt>test/test-volume</tt> test utility, I ended up in the <tt>libgnomevfs/gnome-vfs-filesystem-type.c</tt> file. This contains a table called <tt>fs_data</tt> that maps each file system name to a description and to a boolean. The boolean indicates whether the file system is supposed to hold a trash or not. As you can imagine, <tt>ffs</tt> was not part of this list, so the code felt back to the default values that specify that there was no trash.<br><br>Solving the issue was trivial. I just had to add the appropriate file system names to the table, rebuild gnome-vfs and experience the trash icon to its full power :-) The issue is reported in <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=336533">bug #336533</a> and is already commited to pkgsrc. Therefore, it will be part of the forthcoming pkgsrc-2006Q1 stable branch.</p><p class=text-muted>March 29, 2006

Nowadays, some applications even fail to start if dbus is not present (e.g. epiphany).<br><br>Unfortunately, things do not work out of the box when installing GNOME from sources &mdash; or when using an "uncustomized" OS; see below &mdash; because there is nothing in GNOME that launches a dbus-daemon session at startup. Therefore, the user is forced to either:<ul><li>Change his <tt>~/.xinitrc</tt> to do <tt>exec dbus-launch gnome-session</tt> instead of the traditional <tt>exec gnome-session</tt>.</li><li>Edit his gdm configuration files to launch dbus-daemon before gnome-session.</li></ul>As you can see, both "solutions" are cumbersome because they break the previous behavior and because they require the user to take extra steps to get things working.<br><br>Of course, in the disordered Linux world, distributions such as Ubuntu or Fedora Core include customized and rather complex X startup scripts that launch dbus-daemon during a session setup. Non-dbus-enabled systems (such as NetBSD) could ship modified gdm packages to avoid this problem, but users could still hit a problem when using the traditional startx or other session managers such as xdm or kdm.<br><br>I do not need to mention that some systems (e.g. NetBSD again) will not ever include &mdash; unless things change dramatically &mdash; a call to dbus-daemon in their standard X11 scripts.<br><br>A possible solution is to modify the gnome-session utility to spawn a dbus-daemon process on its own, just as it does with gconf or gnome-keyring. This way the user needn't remember to start dbus on his own as the GNOME session manager will do it automatically. With this in place, GNOME magically works again in these dbus-agnostic systems.<br><br>And yes, this solution is already implemented. It has kept me busy for two days but you can find the code in <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=336237">bug 336327</a>. I hope to get some positive feedback and integrate it into pkgsrc until an official gnome-session release does it (if ever). If it is not integrated... well, I guess I'll have to go the gdm-patching route.<br><br>By the way, I have to say this: more than 300 lines of C code to do something that can be achieved in less than 10 lines of shell script... people seem to like to make their lives more complex than need be ;-)</p><p class=text-muted>March 27, 2006

As I'll be doing this again in a few days (to bring 2.12.2 into the tree), this seems a good moment for the essay. Here I go:<br><br>The first thing I do is to fetch the whole distribution from the FTP site; i.e., the <tt>platform</tt> and <tt>desktop</tt> directories located under the latest stable version. I have a little script that does this for me, avoiding to fetch the distfiles that haven't changed since the previous version.<br><br>Once this is done I generate a list of all the downloaded distfiles and adjust the package dependencies in <tt>meta-pkgs/gnome-devel/Makefile</tt>, <tt>meta-pkgs/gnome-base/Makefile</tt> and <tt>meta-pkgs/gnome/Makefile</tt> to require the new versions; this includes adding any possible new stuff. I do this manually, which is a quite boring task; however, writing a script could take much more time.<br><br>Afterward, I use <tt>cvs diff -u meta-pkgs/gnome* | grep '^+'</tt> over the modified files to get a list of the packages that need to be updated. As the list of dependencies in the meta-packages is sorted in reverse order &mdash; i.e., a package in the n-th position uses packages in the 1..n-1 positions but not any in the n+1..N ones &mdash; this command creates a useful "step by step" guide of what needs to be done.<br><br>Then, it is a matter of updating all the packages that need it, which is, by far, the longest part of the process. I go one by one, bumping their version, building them, installing the results, ensuring the <tt>PLIST</tt> is correct, and generating a <tt>log</tt> file in the same directory that will serve me during the commit part. I also have a little script that automates most of this stuff for a given package &mdash; and, thanks to <tt>verifypc</tt>, this is relatively quick :-)<br><br>In the last part described, there are some packages that always scare me due to the portability problems that plague them over and over again. These include the ones that try to access the hardware to get information, to control multimedia peripherals, to manage network stuff, etc. I don't know why some packages break in similar places in newer versions even if the mainstream developers have been sent some patches to fix the stuff in previous versions. &lt;/rant><br><br>Once I've got the updated <tt>gnome-base</tt> package installed, I zap all my GNOME configuration &mdash; <tt>~/.gconf*</tt>, <tt>~/.nautilus*</tt>, <tt>~/.metacity*</tt>, <tt>~/.gnome*</tt> and a lot more garbage &mdash; and try to start it. At this point, it is mostly useless, but I can see if there are serious problems in any of the most basic libraries. If so, this is the time to go for some bug hunting!<br><br>When the <tt>gnome-base</tt> package works, I continue to update all the other missing packages and try to package the new ones, if any. Adding new stuff is not easy in general (portability bugs again) and this is why some of the dependencies are still commented out in the meta-packages. Anyway, with this done, I finally start the complete desktop and check if there are any major problems with the most "important" applications. Again, if there are any, it is a good time to solve them.<br><br>So all the updates are done, but nobody guarantees that they work, specially because I do all the work under NetBSD-current. So I generally (but not always... shame on me!) use <tt>pkg_comp</tt> to check that they work, at the very least, under the latest stable release (3.0 at this point).<br><br>The last part is to commit all the stuff in a short time window to minimize pain to end users. Even though I have left <tt>log</tt> files all around and prepared the correct entries for the <tt>CHANGES</tt> file, this often takes more than an hour.<br><br>Unfortunately, end users always suffer, either because the packages break on their platform, because our packaging updating tools suck or simply because I made some mistake (e.g., forgot to commit something). But this is what pkgsrc-current is for, isn't it? ;-)<br><br>And, of course, another thing to do is to review all the newly added local patches, clean them up, adapt them to the development versions of their corresponding packages and submit them to <a href=http://bugzilla.gnome.org/>GNOME's bugzilla</a>. This is gratifying, but also a big, big pain.<br><br>Well, well... this has been quite long, but I think I haven't left anything out.</p><p class=text-muted>January 5, 2006

This annoyed me so much that I decided to track down the issue, which I've done today.<br><br>The first thing I did was to attach a gdb session to the currently running Nautilus process, adding some breakpoints to the functions that seemed to generate preview images; I located them using grep(1) and some obvious keywords. This wasn't very helpful, but at least I could see that the thumbnail generation routine checks whether the file is local or not (because Nautilus lets you set different preferences for them).<br><br>With this in mind, I resorted to the traditional and not-so-elegant <tt>printf</tt> debugging technique (which, with pkgsrc in the middle, is quite annoying). Effectively, a call to <tt>gnome_vfs_uri_is_local</tt> was always returning false, no matter which file it was passed. It was clear that the problem was in gnome-vfs itself.<br><br>So I switched to the gnome-vfs code, located that function and saw that it was very short: basically, all it does is delegate its task to another function that depends on the <i>method</i> associated to the file &mdash; you can think of the method as the protocol that manages it. As I was accessing local files, the method in use was the file method (implemented in <tt>modules/file-method.c</tt>), so the affected function was, how not, its <tt>do_is_local</tt>.<br><br>As it is a bit complex (due to caching issues for efficiency), I added some more printfs to it to isolate a bit more the problem, which drove me to the <tt>filesystem_type</tt> function implemented in <tt>modules/fstype.c</tt>. And man, when looking at this function I quickly understood why it was the focus of the problem. It is so clumsy &mdash; portability-wise &mdash; that it is very easy for it to break under untested circumstances: it is composed of a set of mutually exclusive ifdefs (one for each possible situation) to determine the file system name in which a file lives.<br><br>And you guessed right: NetBSD 3.x didn't match any of them, so it resorted to a default entry (returning an <tt>unknown</tt> file system type) that is always treated as remote by the file method code.<br><br>The solution has been to workaround the detection of one of these special cases in the configure script to properly detect statvfs(2) under NetBSD. This is just a hack that adds to the uglyness of the original code, but fixing this issue properly will require a lot of work and the willingness of the gnome-vfs maintainers to accept the changes.<br><br>I will ask for a pull-up to the pkgsrc-2005Q4 branch when I've been able to confirm that this does not break on other NetBSD versions. Now have fun watching your images again! ;-)</p><p class=text-muted>January 1, 2006

The first problem I encountered was that it complained about the excessive permissions given to newly created local sockets (those stored in the file-system, also known as "Unix sockets" historically). After analyzing the issue, I saw that those files were given 777 permissions, regardless of the user's umask. Strangely, the code was explicitly checking for this mode after creation, so I was probably missing something.</p></p><p class=text-muted>August 24, 2005

They were intended to give some background knowledge about that program, to let me easily explain something else: how pkg-config can be used to sanity-check packages — that is, to ensure that the libraries they depend on are the correct ones.</p><p>In <a href=http://www.pkgsrc.org/>pkgsrc</a>, <i>direct</i> dependencies are specified by including special <tt>buildlink3.mk</tt> files. These files have a default version specification in them, so that a reasonable value is kept somewhere centralized. For example, in the current tree, when you include glib2's <tt>buildlink3.mk</tt> file, you get a dependency such as <tt>glib2>=2.6.1</tt>. So far so good.</p></p><p class=text-muted>May 21, 2005

These packages provide pkg-config metadata files <i>in some situations</i>; i.e., not always. This is a quite common situation in libraries that did not use pkg-config in the past, but have been recently converted to do so. Some examples are <a href=http://www.openssl.org/>OpenSSL</a> or the <a href=http://www.x.org/>X libraries</a> (which are being converted to the GNU toolchain by <a href=http://www.freedesktop.org/>Freedesktop.org</a>).</p><p>But why is this a problem? Basically because software developers are not aware of this and simply look for the pkg-config metadata files. E.g., when they need OpenSSL, they simply ask for the <tt>openssl.pc</tt> file through pkg-config; in case of failure, they assume the library is not there, but this assumption can be perfectly wrong. When this happens, those programs should also check for the libraries in a direct manner, bypassing pkg-config.</p></p><p class=text-muted>March 15, 2005

This version is the last one with "big" changes; the branch has now entered the <i>API/ABI freeze</i> and the <i>module and feature freeze</i>. Further versions will not include new features; just new translations, fixes and general polishment.</p><p>Check the <a href=http://www.gnome.org/start/2.7/>2.7 start page</a> for more information.</p><p class=mobile-post></p></p><p class=text-muted>July 24, 2004

It also outlined two possible solutions, or better said, workarounds. I'll explain my solution here, which is already implemented but waiting for approval.</p><p>The idea is to "configure" programs at <i>run time</i> to let them access the view from where they are executed. This is very easy to do: we just have to patch all programs that have this problem so that they use a global environment variable, say <tt>PKG_VIEWBASE</tt>, that points to the root directory of the view being used. Picking the XMMS example again, the program could be modified to search for its input plugins from <tt>${PKG_VIEWBASE}/lib/Input</tt>, falling back to its depot directory if the variable is not set.</p></p><p class=text-muted>July 14, 2004

The <a href=http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2004-June/msg00067.html>official announcement</a> provides more information, including a list of changes since the previous version.<p>Furthermore, I've just updated all the GNOME packages in <a href=http://www.pkgsrc.org/>pkgsrc</a> to their respective versions in this new release. That is, you can easily install GNOME 2.6.2 with the simple <code>cd pkgsrc/meta-pkgs/gnome &&amp; make install</code> command... and on multiple platforms! This may be a good reason to try this excellent package system today ;-)</p></p><p class=text-muted>June 28, 2004

I know choosing one can be difficult, so this post is to give you a suggestion: <i>help the pkgsrc project</i>.</p><a href=http://www.pkgsrc.org/>pkgsrc</a> is The <a href=http://www.netbsd.org/>NetBSD</a> Packages Collection. Despite its name, it works on many other operating systems, like Linux, Solaris or MacOS X, to name some. pkgsrc provides a package tree from where you can install any kind of program. It takes care to download the sources, configure and build them and install the results. It also handles all required dependencies.<p>To start using pkgsrc, you must get a copy of the package tree and learn how to use it. The <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/Packages.txt?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">pkgsrc manual</a> contains all this information, and the website (linked above) provides a summary of what's needed to get started.</p></p><p class=text-muted>June 24, 2004
