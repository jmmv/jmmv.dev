Well, the answer is: everywhere.
Here are some examples:
Nautilus monitors all open folders so that it can update their contents whenever the underlying file store changes. Say you are viewing the Documents folder and you save a new Document from within OpenOffice into that folder. You definitely want Nautilus to show it immediately, without having to manually hit Refresh from the menu.</description></item><item><title>New gio-fam package</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2010/04/new-gio-fam-package.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2010 13:48:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2010/04/new-gio-fam-package.html</guid><description>As briefly outlined in the previous post, new versions of Glib provide GIO, a library that intends to be a low-level file system API on top of the POSIX interface. This library provides an interface to asynchronously wait for file system change notifications including the creation, deletion and modification of files.
The monitoring functionality in GIO is modular: it is backed by different loadable plugins that implement OS-specific functionality. In particular, GIO uses an inotify module in Linux and a FAM module everywhere else.</description></item><item><title>File system monitoring, Gnome and NetBSD</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2010/04/file-system-monitoring-gnome-and-netbsd.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2010 09:21:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2010/04/file-system-monitoring-gnome-and-netbsd.html</guid><description>A few days ago, I decided to start using NetBSD, as well as Gnome on NetBSD once again, mostly because the lack of their use makes my skills feel rusty in many different areas. While NetBSD has surprised me in a good way (I am running it on a Macbook Pro and things like wireless and DRI work), Gnome has not. There are tons of broken things that prevent a smooth user experience.</description></item><item><title>Software bloat, 2</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2008/02/software-bloat-2.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2008 17:27:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2008/02/software-bloat-2.html</guid><description>A long while ago &amp;mdash; just before buying the MacBook Pro &amp;mdash; I already complained about software bloat. A year and two months later, it is time to complain again.
I am thinking on renewing my MacBook Pro assuming I can sell this one for a good price. The reasons for this are to get slightly better hardware (more disk, better GPU and maybe 4GB of RAM) and software updates. The problem is: if I am able to find a buyer, I will be left without a computer for some days, and that's not a good scenario.</description></item><item><title>A letter to NetBSD</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2006/09/letter-to-netbsd.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Sep 2006 13:21:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2006/09/letter-to-netbsd.html</guid><description>Dear NetBSD,
It is almost five years since we first met and I still remember how much I liked you at that time. Despite your 1.5 release had slow disk performance when compared to the other BSDs, I found in you an operating system that just felt right. You focused on clean and well designed code among many other goals; sincerely, I didn't come to you looking for portability because I never had anything else than i386 machines.</description></item><item><title>GNOME on NetBSD needs YOU!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2006/09/gnome-on-netbsd-needs-you.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2006 15:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2006/09/gnome-on-netbsd-needs-you.html</guid><description>A few pkgsrc developers and I have been working hard for years to bring the GNOME Desktop to this packaging system and make it work under NetBSD. We are quite happy with the current results because the packages are updated very frequently and everything works. Well, almost. There are still several missing details that really hurt the end user experience and need fixing.
If things continue as have gone until now, we will always be one step (or more!</description></item><item><title>Recent GNOME fixes</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2006/08/recent-gnome-fixes.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2006 11:02:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2006/08/recent-gnome-fixes.html</guid><description>A week has almost passed since someone told me that D-Bus' session daemon was broken in NetBSD. I curse that day! ;-) I've been investigating that problem since then and (very) beleatedly fixing some issues in other GNOME programs during the process.
D-Bus' session daemon did not work under NetBSD because it couldn't authenticate incoming connections; that was due to the lack of socket credentials. After some of days of investigation &amp;mdash; which included discovering that NetBSD does indeed support socket credentials through LOCAL_CREDS &amp;mdash; and multiple attempts to implement them, I finally got D-Bus session daemon to authenticate appropriately.</description></item><item><title>GNOME 2.14.3 hits pkgsrc</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2006/08/gnome-2143-hits-pkgsrc.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2006 12:33:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2006/08/gnome-2143-hits-pkgsrc.html</guid><description>Last night I finished updating the GNOME meta packages in pkgsrc to the latest stable version, 2.14.3. Yes, I had to take a break from Boost.Process coding (which is progressing nicely by the way; check the docs).
The meta packages had been stalled at 2.14.0 since the big update back in April which shows how few time I've had to do any pkgsrc work â€” well, you can also blame the iBook with its Mac OS X, if you want to ;-) Luckily the packages are now up to date, but I hope they'll not get stalled at this version for too long: 2.</description></item><item><title>X11 and the Win keys</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2006/08/x11-and-win-keys.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2006 06:29:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2006/08/x11-and-win-keys.html</guid><description>For quite some time I've been having issues with the Windows keys in my Spanish keyboard under X11. I like to use these as an extra modifier (Mod4) instead of a regular key (Super_L), because it is very handy when defining keybindings. The X11 default seems to treat them as Super_L only. For example, trying to attach Win+N as a keybinding to one of the actions in the GNOME Keyboard Shortcuts panel resulted in the Super_L combination instead of Mod4+L, hence not working at all.</description></item><item><title>Disabling bitmapped fonts</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2006/06/disabling-bitmapped-fonts.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jun 2006 15:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2006/06/disabling-bitmapped-fonts.html</guid><description>A week ago or so I reinstalled NetBSD &amp;mdash; 3.0_STABLE, not current &amp;mdash; on my machine, finally replacing the previous unstable and out-of-control system. I had to do it to get some work done more easily than on Windows and to be able to keep up with my developer duties.
After a successful and painless installation, I built and installed Firefox and Windowmaker, both of which come handy from time to time (specially while rebuilding the entire GNOME Desktop).</description></item><item><title>GNOME 2.14.0 hits pkgsrc</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2006/04/gnome-2140-hits-pkgsrc.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Apr 2006 06:37:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2006/04/gnome-2140-hits-pkgsrc.html</guid><description>After three weeks of intense work, I am pleased to announce that GNOME 2.14 is now available in pkgsrc, the NetBSD Packages Collection.
As happens with all other major GNOME releases, this one provides a set of polishments, cleanups and several new features over the 2.12 series. You can find more information in the official release page (linked above).
I am happy to say that this release works fairly well under NetBSD.</description></item><item><title>Fixing GNOME's trash under NetBSD</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2006/03/fixing-gnomes-trash-under-netbsd.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2006 15:52:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2006/03/fixing-gnomes-trash-under-netbsd.html</guid><description>For a very long long time (probably since forever), the trash icon in GNOME has not worked in NetBSD. You'd drag files onto it and they were appropriately deleted but, unfortunately, the trash did not update its status to reflect the removed files. If you opened the folder, it appeared empty despite ~/.Trash contained the deleted files. As you can image this was very annoying as it made the trash near to useless.</description></item><item><title>GNOME and the dbus daemon</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2006/03/gnome-and-dbus-daemon.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2006 16:10:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2006/03/gnome-and-dbus-daemon.html</guid><description>It is a fact that dbus is becoming popular and that many parts of GNOME are starting to use it. Nowadays, some applications even fail to start if dbus is not present (e.g. epiphany).
Unfortunately, things do not work out of the box when installing GNOME from sources &amp;mdash; or when using an "uncustomized" OS; see below &amp;mdash; because there is nothing in GNOME that launches a dbus-daemon session at startup.</description></item><item><title>GNOME 2.14.0 released</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2006/03/gnome-2140-released.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2006 14:40:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2006/03/gnome-2140-released.html</guid><description>OK, I know this comes late but I had to publish it. GNOME 2.14.0 was published a few days ago. As happens with all other major releases in the 2.x series, this one comes with several improvements and tons of bug fixes. Note that these are not "very big" changes; they can be seen as minor refinements over the previous version, aiming for a better user experience. You can check this review for more information.</description></item><item><title>Linux problems: binary redistribution</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2006/03/linux-problems-binary-redistribution.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2006 07:39:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2006/03/linux-problems-binary-redistribution.html</guid><description>thomasvs (who appears in Planet GNOME) is running a post titled How not to solve a problem in his blog. He talks about the aggressive tone used in a page from Autopackage's wiki and how it can cause a bad impression of that project. (I was going to reply to his post in his blog but commenting is unsupported... so posting this here.)
That "Linux problems" page talks about many issues that arise when trying to redistribute software in binary form for the Linux platform.</description></item></channel></rss>
