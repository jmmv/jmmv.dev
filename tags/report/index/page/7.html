I haven't made a decision yet, but I'm pretty convinced this is the right way to go. It will simplify development significantly, it will allow me to code offline (have a bunch of really long flights coming), and it will lower the entry barrier to Kyua by making all components use the same, mainstream VCS.</li><li>Implemented filtering by result type of the test case results in the textual reports.</li></ul><div>I think it is time to prepare a 0.3 release. I wanted to wait until we had HTML reports in place, but this will require significant effort and I have been postponing the implementation for too long already. As it is now, the current codebase provides major changes since the ancient 0.2 release and it is worth a release. Then, we can create packages for NetBSD and Fedora instead of continuing to add new features, which should be a good step in giving further visibility to the project. Finally, we can reserve HTML reporting as the major feature for 0.4 :-)</div></p><p class=text-muted>February 13, 2012

Well, that's a good question. Recording test results opens the gate to many long-awaited features that should be coming soon, such as the ability to inspect the history of a particular test, to query all available data of a test result and/or to generate a dashboard of test results. It's interesting to realize that <i>most of these features are just one SQL query away</i>. If you install Kyua, you can already run a few tests and then use <tt>kyua db-exec</tt> to issue arbitrary SQL queries against the database; the schema (see <tt>store/schema.sql</tt>) might look a bit convoluted, but a bunch of <tt>NATURAL JOIN</tt>s will yield the desired output.<br><br>The feature requests that have the highest priority at this point are the ability to generate a report of the last tests run both as a text file and as an HTML dashboard, because having these features means we can finally kill the <tt>atf-run</tt> and <tt>atf-report</tt> pair.

The conference was composed of lots of interesting content and hosted many influential and insightful BSD developers. While the NetBSD presence was very reduced, I could have some valuable talks with both NetBSD and FreeBSD developers.<br><br>Anyway. As part of BSDCan 2011, I gave a talk titled "<a href=http://www.bsdcan.org/2011/schedule/events/223.en.html>Automated testing in NetBSD: past, present and future</a>". The talk focused on explaining what led to the development of ATF in the context of NetBSD, what related technologies exist in NetBSD (<a href=http://www.netbsd.org/docs/puffs/rump.html>rump</a>, <a href=http://www.gson.org/netbsd/anita/>anita</a>&nbsp;and <a href=http://releng.netbsd.org/test-results.html>dashboards</a>), what ATF's shortcomings are and how Kyua plans to resolve them. (Video coming soon, I hope.)<br><br>The talk was later followed by several questions and off-session conversations about testing in general in BSDs. Among these, I gathered a few random ideas / feelings:<br><br><ul><li>The POSIX 1003.3 standard defines the particular results a test can emit (see the <a href=http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/dejagnu/dejagnu_6.html>corresponding DejaGnu documentation</a>). Both ATF and Kyua already implement all the results defined in the standard, but they use different names and extend the standard with many extra results. Given that the standard does not define useful concepts like "expected failures", an idea that came up is to provide a flag to force POSIX compliance at the cost of being less useful. Why? Just for the sake of saying that Kyua conforms to this standard.</li><li>The audience seemed to like the idea of a "tests results store" quite a bit, and the sound of SQLite for the implementation was not bullied. This is something I'm eager to work on, but not before I publish a 0.1 release.</li><li>I highlighted the possibility of allowing Kyua to run "foreign" test programs so that we could integrate the results into the database. This could be useful to run tests for which we (*BSD) have no control (e.g. gcc) in an integrated manner. The idea was not bullied by anyone either.</li><li>FreeBSD has already been looking at ATF / Kyua and they are open to collaboration.</li><li>OpenBSD won't import any new C++ code, and adding C-based tests to the tree while relegating the C++ runtime to the ports is not an option. Somehow I expected this.</li><li>Junos (the FreeBSD-based operating system from Jupiter Networks) recently imported ATF and they are happy with it so far. Yay!</li><li>Would be nice to have a feature to run tests remotely after, maybe, deploying a single particular test and its dependencies. This is gonna be tricky and not in my current immediate plans.</li></ul><div>Other than that, I had little time to do some coding:</div><div><ul><li>Fixed a problem in which both ATF and Kyua were not correctly resetting the timezone of the executed tests. I only found this because, after arriving in Canada, some Kyua tests would start to fail. (Yes, the fix is in both code bases!)</li><li>Added some support to capture deadly signals that terminate Kyua so that Kyua can print an informational message stating that something went wrong and which log file contains more information. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/detail?r=121">See r121</a>.</li></ul><div>That's it folks! Thanks to those attending the conference and, in particular, to those that came to my talk :-)</div></div></p><p class=text-muted>May 16, 2011

I just finished a multi-hour hacking session to get the implementation of the <span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">list</span>&nbsp;subcommand in control. It is now in a very nice user-facing shape, although its code deserves a little bit of house cleaning (coming soon).<br><br>Anyway, this week's progress:<br><br><ul><li>Added the <span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">kyuaify.sh</span> script. This little tool takes a test suite (say, NetBSD's <span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">/usr/tests</span> directory) and converts all its <span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">Atffile</span>s into <span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">Kyuafile</span>s. The tool is no sophisticated at all; in fact, it is a pretty simple script that I haven't tested with any other test suites so far. See the <a href=https://groups.google.com/group/kyua-discuss/browse_thread/thread/d0077d8992a04bf0>announcement of kyuaify</a> for some extra details.</li><li>Added logging support for the Lua code and changed the Lua modules to spit some logging information while processing Kyuafiles and configuration files.</li><li>Added a mechanism in the user interface module to consistently print informational, warning and error messages.</li><li>Implemented proper test filtering (after several iterations). What does proper mean? Well, for starters, test filters are always relative to the test suite's root (although we already saw this in last week's report). But the most important thing is that the filters are now validated: nice, user-friendly errors will be reported when the collection of tests is non-disjoint, when it includes duplicate names or when any of the provided filters does not match any test case. I really need to document the rationale of these in the manual, but for now the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/detail?r=118">r118 commit message</a> includes a few details.</li><li>Drafted some notes for the BSDCan 2011 conference. I am quite tempted to reuse parts of the presentation from NYCBSDCon 2010, but I really want to give more emphasis on Kyua this time. In case you don't know, Kyua was first announced in NYCBSDCon 2010 and it was still a very immature project. The project has changed a lot since then.</li></ul><div>The wishful plan for next week is to clean up the internals of the <span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">list</span>&nbsp;command (by refactoring and adding unit tests) and implement preliminary integration tests for the <span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">test</span>&nbsp;subcommand. The latter scares me quite a bit. But... hmm... I guess preparing the presentation for BSDCan 2011 has priority.</div></p><p class=text-muted>April 24, 2011

These were pretty easy to do.</li><li>Added integration tests for the <b>list</b> subcommand. I initially added these tests as <i>expected failures</i> to reason about the appearance and behavior of this command from the point of view of the user before actually working on the code... and I am still writing such code to make these tests pass!</li></ul><div>This is where things got a bit awry. Polishing the behavior of the list command so that its interface is consistent among all flag and argument combinations is tricky and non-trivial. I ended up having to change code deep down in the source tree to implement missing features and to change existing bits and pieces:</div><div><div><ul><li>Implemented support to print all test case properties, not only the user-specific ones. The properties recognized by the runtime engine are stored as individual arguments of a structure, so these required some externalization code.</li><li>Implemented "test case filtering". This allows users to select what tests to run on the command line at the test case granularity. For example, <span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">foo/bar</span> selects all tests in a subdirectory if <span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">bar</span> is a directory, or all the tests in the <span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">bar</span> test program if it is a binary. But what is new (read: not found in ATF) is that you can even do <span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">foo/bar:test-1</span> where <span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">test-1</span> is the name of a test case within the foo/bar test program. I've been silently wishing for this feature to be available in ATF because it shortens the build/test/edit cycle, but it was not easy to add.</li><li>Changed the internal representation of test suites to ensure all test program names are relative to the root of the test suite. The root of the test suite is considered to be the directory in which the top-level Kyuafile lives (<span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">/usr/tests/</span> in NetBSD). The whole point of doing this is to provide some consistency to the filters when the user decides to execute tests that are not in the current directory. For example, the following are now equivalent:<br><span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">$ cd /usr/tests && kyua list fs/tmpfs</span><br><span class=Apple-style-span style="font-family:courier new,Courier,monospace">$ kyua list -k /usr/tests/Kyuafile fs/tmpfs</span></li></ul></div></div><div>The plans for the upcoming week are to finish with the clean up of the list command (which involves adding proper error reporting, refactoring of the command module and addition of unit tests) and start cleaning up the test command.</div><div><br></div><div>Also, remember that <a href=http://www.bsdcan.org/2011/>BSDCan 2011</a> is now around the corner and that <a href=http://www.bsdcan.org/2011/schedule/events/223.en.html>I will be talking about ATF, Kyua and NetBSD</a> in it! &nbsp;My plan was to have a kyua-cli-0.1 release by the time of the conference, although this will be tricky to achieve...</div></p><p class=text-muted>April 17, 2011

I keep being incredibly busy on the weekends (read: traveling!) so it's hard to get any serious development work done.<br><br>What has happened?<br><br><ul><li>Finally tracked down and fixed some random atf-run crashes that had been hunting the NetBSD test suite for months (see <a href="http://gnats.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/query-pr-single.pl?number=44176">PR bin/44176</a>). The fix is in reality an ugly workaround for the fact that a work directory cannot be considered "stable" even after the test case terminates. There may be dying processes around that touch the work directory contents, and the cleanup code in atf-run was not coping well with those. As it turns out, this problem also exists in Kyua (even though it's not as pronounced because arbitrary failures when running a test case do not crash the runtime engine) so I filed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/issues/detail?id=17">issue 17</a> to address it.</li><li><a href=http://www.netbsd.org/~jmmv/atf/news.html#20110331-atf-0-13-released>Released ATF 0.13</a> and imported it both to NetBSD-current and pkgsrc. As a side note, Kyua requires the new features in this release, so putting it out there is a requirement to release Kyua 0.1. This new release does not have a big effect on NetBSD though, because the copy of ATF in NetBSD has been constantly receiving cherry-picks of the upstream fixes.</li><li>Replaced several TODO items in the Kyua code with proper calls to the logging subsystem. These TODO items were referring to conditions in the code that should not happen, but for which we cannot do any proper recovery (like errors in a destructor). Sure, these could be better signaled as an assertion... but these code paths can be triggered in extremely-tricky conditions and having Kyua crash because of them is not nice (particularly when the side-effects of executing that code paths are non-critical).</li></ul><div>So, in retrospect, I have fulfilled the goal set past week of releasing ATF 0.13, but I haven't got to the addition of integration tests.

In the <a href=/2011/03/kyua-weekly-status-report.html>previous report</a>, I set the goal of&nbsp;getting Kyua to run the NetBSD test suite accurately (i.e. to report the same results as atf-run), and this has been accomplished. Actually, the changes required in Kyua to make this happen were minimal, but I got side-tracked fixing issues in NetBSD itself (both in the test suite and in the kernel!). So, the things done:<br><ul><li>Fixed Kyua to correctly kill any dangling subprocesses of a test case and thus match the behavior of atf-run. This was the only change required to make <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/issues/detail?id=16">issue 16</a> happen: i.e. to get Kyua to report the same results as atf-run for the NetBSD test suite.</li><ul><li>Based on a suggestion from Antti Kantee, an alternative way to handle this would be to not kill any processes and just report the test case as broken if it fails to clean itself up. The rationale being that the runtime engine can kill dangling subprocesses in 99% of the occasions, but not always. The exception are those subprocesses that change their process group. It'd be better to make all cleanups explicit instead of hiding this corner case, as it can lead to confusion. Addressing this will have to wait though, as it is a pretty invasive change.</li><li>Before closing issue 16, I want to implement some integration tests for Kyua to ensure that the whole system behaves as we expect (which is what the NetBSD test suite is currently doing implicitly).</li></ul><li>Kyua is pickier than atf-run: if a cleanup routine of a test case fails or crashes, Kyua will (correctly) report the test case as broken while atf-run will silently ignore this situation.

In particular, whenever a new feature request for <a href=http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/atf/>ATF</a> comes in, I promise the requester that the feature will be addressed as part of Kyua. However, I can imagine that this behavior leaves the requester with mixed feelings: it is nice that the feature will be implemented but, at the same time, it is very hard to know when because the web site of Kyua does not provide many details about its current status.<br><br>In an attempt to give Kyua some more visibility, I will start posting weekly activity reports in this blog. These reports will also include any work done on the ATF front, as the two projects are highly related at this point. I write these reports regularly at work and I feel like it is a pretty good habit: every week, you have to spend some time thinking about what you did for the project and you feel guilty if the list of tasks is ~zero ;-) It also, as I said, gives more visibility to the work being done so that outsiders know that the project is not being ignored.<br><br>Before starting with what has happened this week, a bit of context. I have been traveling like crazy and hosting guests over for the last 2 months. This has given me virtually no time to work on Kyua but, finally, I have got a chance to do some work this past week.<br><br>So, what are the news?<ul><li>Implemented the <tt>--loglevel</tt> command line flag, which closes <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://code.google.com/p/kyua/issues/detail?id=14">issue 14</a>. Kyua now generates run-time logs of its internal activity to aid in postmortem debugging and this flag allows the user to control the verbosity of such logs.</li><li>Antti Kantee hacked support for atf-run in the NetBSD source tree to dump a stack trace of any crashing test program. I have backported this code to the upstream ATF code and filed <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://code.google.com/p/kyua/issues/detail?id=15">issue 15</a> to implement this same functionality in Kyua.</li><li>Fixed a hang in atf-run that made it get stuck when a test case spawned a child processes and atf-run failed to terminate it. A quick test seems to indicate that Kyua is affected by a similar problem: it does not get stuck but it does not correctly kill the subprocesses. The problem will be addressed as part of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http://code.google.com/p/kyua/issues/detail?id=16">issue 16</a>.</li><li>Oh, and by the way: Kyua will be <a href=http://www.bsdcan.org/2011/schedule/events/223.en.html>presented at BSDCan 2011</a>.</li></ul>My plans for this week are to make Kyua run the full NetBSD test suite without regressions when compared to ATF. Basically, the results of a test run with Kyua should be exactly the same as those of a test run with ATF. No dangling processes should be left behind.<br><br>Lastly, if you are interested in these reports and other Kyua news, you can subscribe to the <i>kyua label feed</i> and, if you want to stay up to date with <i>any</i> changes performed to the code, subscribe to the <a href=https://groups.google.com/group/kyua-log>kyua-log</a> mailing list.</p><p class=text-muted>March 20, 2011
