      <description>A couple of things happened this week:
Spent quite a few time researching the idea of moving away from Monotone and Subversion to Git. I haven&#39;t made a decision yet, but I&#39;m pretty convinced this is the right way to go. It will simplify development significantly, it will allow me to code offline (have a bunch of really long flights coming), and it will lower the entry barrier to Kyua by making all components use the same, mainstream VCS.</description>

Created an RPM package for Lutok for inclusion in Fedora.Created a preliminary RPM spec for ATF for Fedora. Now in discussions with the FPC to figure out how to install the tests on a Fedora system, as /usr/tests may not be appropriate.No activity on Kyua itself though, unfortunately. </description>

      <description>This comes two days late... but anyway, I felt like posting it now instead of waiting until next Sunday/Monday.
The activity past week focused mostly on implementing support for the require.memory test-case metadata property recently introduced into ATF. This was non-trivial due to the need to write some tricky Autoconf code to make this &#34;slightly portable&#34;.&amp;nbsp;Seriously: It&#39;s scary to see how hard it is to perform, in a portable manner, an operation as simple as &#34;</description>

      <description>Released ATF 0.15 and imported it into NetBSD.Added support for integer/float printf-like modifiers to the utils::format module. These will be required to beautify size and time quantities in the reports and error messages.I spent way more time than I wanted on this. At first, I attempted to use std::snprintf to parse and process the format modifiers for integers and floats so that I could avoid implementing a custom parser for them.</description>

      <description>Finally some progress!
Backported the require.memory changes in NetBSD to the ATF upstream code, and extended them to support OS X as well.Backported local pkgsrc patches to ATF into the upstream code.Started to prepare ATF 0.15 by doing test runs of NetBSD/i386 and NetBSD/amd64 and by building the code in various Linux distributions. Several build bugs fixed along the way.Spent a long while trying to figure out how the Fedora package maintainer procedure has changed since 3 years ago to create packages for ATF, Lutok and Kyua.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s that time of the week again (although delayed by over a day). Unfortunately, no progress either during past week. Being on semi-vacations doesn&#39;t leave much &#34;free time&#34;... However, I traveled back home yesterday and getting back to my daily routine should give some spare time!</description>

      <description>The post title should mention ATF instead of Kyua... but I&#39;m keeping the usual one for consistency:
Integrated timestamps into the XML and HTML reports generated by atf-report. These should soon show up in the continuous tests of NetBSD.Work on integrating the use of POSIX timers into atf-run after Christos Zoulas performed these changes in the NetBSD tree. The result is quite awful because I need to keep compatibility with systems that do not provide the &#34;</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, not much activity this week due to travel reasons. Anyway, some work went in:
Preliminary code to generate HTML reports from kyua report. This is easy peasy but boring. The current code was written as a proof of concept and is awful, hence why it was not committed. I&#39;m now working in cleaning it up.Backported test program and test case timestamping into ATF based on a patch from Paul Goyette.</description>

      <description>Some significant improvements this week:
Finally submitted the code to store and load full test case definitions. This is quite tricky (and currently very, very ugly) but it works and it will allow the reports to include all kinds of information from the test cases.Removed the Atffiles from the tree; yay! For a long time, I had been using atf-run to run broken tests because atf-run allowed me to watch the output of the test case being debugged.</description>

      <description>Some more work towards allowing storing and loading of full test case definitions (which in turn will allow us to provide detailed HTML reports). I have local changes that do this, but they are gated by the lack of some additional tests and probably some optimizations, because they slow down kyua report significantly. Regarding commits, I have only submitted some related cleanup-changes.I got distracted by invalid Doxygen comments and traced down why they were not being correctly validated (which is the whole point of running Doxygen during the build).</description>

      <description>My goal for this past week was to change the database layer to be able to store full definitions of the test cases, and to later be able to load these while scanning an action. This is to allow the report command to provide all kinds of information about the executed tests, not just their names and their results. However, adding this functionality has proven to be more complex than I wished because the current types to represent test programs and test cases are kinda broken: that the abstractions chosen a while ago do not seem to be appropriate, and this is complicating further changes.</description>

      <description>I only have one thing to report this week, but oh boy it&#39;s big: the report command finally reports the results of a run of a test suite! Yes, you heard well: Kyua is, finally, able to keep a record of all the previous executions of test suites and allows you to extract reports of any of them a posteriori.

At the moment, the report is just some disorganized plain-text.</description>

      <description>Kyua has finally gained a report subcommand, aimed at processing the output data of an action (stored in the database) and generating a user-friendly report in a variety of formats. This is still extremely incomplete, so don&#39;t get your hopes too high yet ;-) The current version of the report command takes an action and all it does is dump its runtime context (run directory, environment variables, etc.). Consider it just a proof of concept.</description>

      <description>Many things have happened this week, but they can all be summarized in one single sentence: kyua test now records the results of the execution of a test suite into the SQLite database.
&#34;Why is this important?&#34;, you ask. Well, that&#39;s a good question. Recording test results opens the gate to many long-awaited features that should be coming soon, such as the ability to inspect the history of a particular test, to query all available data of a test result and/or to generate a dashboard of test results.</description>
