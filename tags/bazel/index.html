<h2 class=mt-0><a href=/2021/03/build-time-slis-slos.html>Defining build time SLIs and SLOs</a></h2>
<p>Companies grow, and with them do the software projects that support them. It should be no surprise that larger programs require longer build times. And, if I had to guess, you have seen how those build times eventually grow to unbearable levels, reducing productivity and degrading quality. In this post, I examine how we can leverage the common techniques we use for production services&mdash;namely SLIs and SLOs&mdash;to keep build times on track.</p>

<p>Monorepos are an interesting beast. If mended properly, they enable a level of uniformity and code quality that is hard to achieve otherwise. If left unattended, however, they become unmanageable monsters of tangled dependencies, slow builds, and frustrating developer experiences. Whether you have a good or bad experience directly depends on the level of engineering support behind the monorepo. Simply put, monorepos require dedicated teams and tools to run nicely. In this post, I will look at how almost-perfect caching plays a key role in keeping build times manageable under such an environment.</p>

<p>During my 11 years at Google, I can confidently count the number of times I had to do a &ldquo;clean build&rdquo; with one hand: their build system is so robust that incremental builds always work. Phrases like &ldquo;clean everything and try building from scratch&rdquo; are unheard of. So&mldr; you can color me skeptical when someone says that incremental build problems are due to bugs in the build files and not due to a suboptimal build system. The answer lies in having a robust build system, and in this post I&rsquo;ll examine the common causes behind incremental build breakages, what the build system can do to avoid them, and how Bazel accomplishes most of them.</p>

<p>As you might have read elsewhere, I&rsquo;m leaving the Bazel team and Google in about a week. My plan for these last few weeks was to hand things off as cleanly as possible&mldr; but I was also nerd-sniped by a bug that came my way a fortnight ago. Fixing it has been my self-inflicted punishment for leaving, and oh my, it has been painful. Very painful.
Let me tell you the story of this final boss.</p>

<h2 class=mt-0><a href=/2020/09/bazel-test-streaming-bug.html>Bazel output streaming, Ctrl+C, and test flakiness</a></h2>
<p>About two weeks ago, I found a very interesting bug in Bazel&rsquo;s test output streaming functionality while writing tests for a new feature related to Ctrl+C interrupts. I fixed the bug, wrote a test for it, and&mldr; the test itself came back as flaky, which made me find another very subtle bug in the test that needed a one-line fix. This is the story of both.
Bazel has a feature known as test output streaming: by default, Bazel captures the outputs (stdout and stderr) of the tests it runs, saves those in local log files, and tells the user where they are when a test fails.</p>

<p>About a month ago, I was benchmarking the impact of a new Bazel feature and I noticed that a test build that should have taken only a few seconds took almost 10 minutes. My Internet connection was flaking out indeed, but something else didn&rsquo;t seem right. So I looked and found that Bazel was doing network calls within a critical section, and these were the root cause behind the massive slowdown. But how did we get such an obvious no-no into the codebase? Read on to see how this happened and how gnarly it was to fix!

<p>Back in September 2019, I embarked into the task of rewriting Bazel&rsquo;s dynamic scheduler to deal with slow and flaky networks. Initial testing had shown that dynamic builds might become slower, and it was all due to this feature having been designed for a different use case (in-office, high-speed network). We had to fix two different issues in the scheduler.
The first fix was making the downloads of the remote artifacts happen without holding the output lock.</p>

<p>I just spent sometime between 30 minutes and 1 hour convincing the Mac Pro that sits in my office to successfully codesign an iOS app via Bazel. This was after having to update the signing key to a newer one and after rebooting the machine due to the macOS 10.15.5 upgrade—all remotely thanks to COVID-19.
The build of the app was failing with an errSecInternalComponent error printed by codesign. It is not the first time I face this, but in all previous cases, I had either been at the computer to click through security popups, had had functional Chrome Remote Desktop access, or did not have to install a new signing key remotely.</p>

<p>You probably know that software rewrites, while very tempting, are expensive and can be the mistake that kills a project or a company. Yet they are routinely proposed as the solution to all problems. Is there anything you can do to minimize the risk? In this post, I propose that you actively improve the old system to ensure the new system cannot make progress in a haphazard way. This forces the new system to be designed in such a way that delivers breakthrough improvements and not just incremental improvements.</p>

It&rsquo;s already 2020 and I&rsquo;m only 17 days late in writing a first post. I was planning to start with an opinion article, but as its draft is taking longer than I wanted&mldr; I&rsquo;ll present you the story of a recent crazy bug that has kept me busy for the last couple of days.

<p>To conclude the deep dive into Bazel&rsquo;s dynamic spawn strategy, let&rsquo;s look at the nightmare that tree artifacts have been with the local lock-free feature. And, yes, I&rsquo;m double-posting today because I really want to finish these series before the end of the decade1!
Tree artifacts are a fancy name for action outputs that are directories, not files. What&rsquo;s special about them is that Bazel does not know a priori what the directory contents are: the rule behind the action just specifies that there will be a directory with files, and Bazel has to treat that as the unit of output from the action.</p>

<p>In the previous post, we saw how accounting for artifact download times makes the dynamic strategy live to its promise of delivering the best of local and remote build times.
Or does it? If you think about it closely, that change made it so that builds that were purely local couldn&rsquo;t be made worse by enabling the dynamic scheduler: the dynamic strategy would always favor the local branch of a spawn if the remote one took a long time.</p>

<p>In the previous post of this series, we looked at how the now-legacy implementation of the dynamic strategy uses a per-spawn lock to guard accesses to the output tree. This lock is problematic for a variety of reasons and we are going to peek into one of those here.
To recap, the remote strategy does the following:
Send spawn execution RPC to the remote service. Wait for successful execution (which can come quickly from a cache hit).</p>

<h2 class=mt-0><a href=/2019/12/bazel-dynamic-execution-output-locking.html>Output conflicts and dynamic execution</a></h2>
<p>When the dynamic scheduler is active, Bazel runs the same spawn (aka command line) remotely and locally at the same time via two separate strategies. These two strategies want to write to the same output files (e.g. object files, archives, or final binaries) on the local disk. In computing, two things trying to affect the same thing require some kind of coördination.
You might think, however, that because we assume that both strategies are equivalent and will write the same contents to disk1, this is not problematic.</p>

<p>After introducing Bazel&rsquo;s dynamic execution a couple of posts ago, it&rsquo;s time to dive into its actual implementation details as promised. But pardon for the interruption in the last post, as I had to take a little detour to cover a necessary topic (local resources) for today&rsquo;s article.
Simply put, dynamic execution is implemented as &ldquo;just&rdquo; one more strategy called dynamic. The dynamic strategy, however, is different from all others because it does not have a corresponding spawn runner.</p>

<p>How does Bazel avoid melting your workstation with concurrent subprocesses? Or&mldr; tries to, because I know it still does that sometimes? There are two mechanisms as play: the jobs number and the local resources tracker. Let&rsquo;s dive into them.
The jobs number, given by the --jobs flag, configures the number of concurrent Skyframe evaluators during the execution phase1. What a mouthful. What this essentially means is that jobs indicates the number of threads used to walk the graph looking for actions to execute&mdash;and also executing them.</p>

<p>Bazel&rsquo;s dynamic execution is a feature that makes your builds faster by using remote and local resources, transparently and at the same time. We launched this feature in Bazel 0.21 back in February 2019 along an introductory blog post and have been hard at work since then to improve it.
The reason dynamic execution makes builds faster is two-fold:
first, because we can hide hiccups in the connectivity to the remote build service; and, second, because we can take advantage of things like persistent workers, which are designed to offer super-fast edit/build/test cycles.</p>

Dynamic execution has been quite a hot topic in my work over the last few months and I am getting ready to publish a series of posts on it soon. But before I do that, I need to first review Bazel&rsquo;s execution strategies because they play a big role in understanding what dynamic execution is and how it&rsquo;s implemented.</p>

Now is the time to investigate this same topic on macOS.

macOS has a bunch of fancy features that other systems do not have, but process control is not among them.</p>

<p>In the previous post, we saw why waiting for a process group to terminate is important (at least in the context of Bazel), and we also saw why this is a difficult thing to do in a portable manner. So today, let&rsquo;s dive into how to do this properly on a Linux system.
On Linux, we have two routes: using the child subreaper feature or using PID namespaces. We&rsquo;ll focus on the former because that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll use to fix (#10245) the process wrapper1, and because they are sufficient to fully address our problem.</p>

<p>Process groups are a feature of Unix systems to group related processes under a common identifier, known as the PGID. Using the PGID, one can look for these related process and send signals in unison to them. This is typically used by shell interpreters to manage processes.
For example, let&rsquo;s launch a shell command that puts two sleep invocations in the background (those with the 10- and 20-second delays) and then sleeps the direct child (with a 5-second delay)&mdash;while also putting the whole invocation in the background so that we can inspect what&rsquo;s going on:</p>

<p>As strange as it may sound, a very important job of any build tool is to orchestrate the execution of lots of other programs&mdash;and Bazel is no exception.
Once Bazel has finished loading and analyzing the build graph, Bazel enters the execution phase. In this phase, the primary thing that Bazel does is walk the graph looking for actions to execute. Then, for each action, Bazel invokes its commands&mdash;things like compiler and linker invocations&mdash;as subprocesses.</p>

<h2 class=mt-0><a href=/2019/11/macos-sandbox-exec.html>A quick glance at macOS' sandbox-exec</a></h2>
<p>macOS includes a sandboxing mechanism to closely control what processes can do on the system. Sandboxing can restrict file system accesses on a path level, control which host/port pairs can be reached over the network, limit which binaries can be executed, and much more. All applications installed via the App Store are subject to sandboxing.
This sandboxing functionality is exposed via the sandbox-exec(1) command-line utility, which unfortunately has been listed as deprecated for at least the last two major versions of macOS.</p>

<p>Bazel likes creating very deep and large trees on disk during a build. One example is the output tree, which naturally contains all the artifacts of your build. Another, more problematic example is the symlink forest trees created for every action when sandboxing is enabled. As garbage gets created, it must be deleted.
It turns out, however, that deleting file system trees can be very expensive&mdash;and especially so on macOS. In fact, calls to our deleteTree algorithm routinely showed up in my profiling runs when trying to diagnose slowdowns using the dynamic scheduler.</p>

<p>Since the publication of Bazel a few years ago, users have reported (and I myself have experienced) general slowdowns when Bazel is running on Macs: things like the window manager stutter and others like the web browser cannot load new pages. Similarly, after the introduction of the dynamic spawn scheduler, some users reported slower builds than pure remote or pure local builds, which made no sense.
All along we guessed that these problems were caused by Bazel&rsquo;s abuse of system threads, as it used to spawn 200 runnable threads during analysis and used to run 200 concurrent compiler subprocesses.</p>

In fact, I&rsquo;m exceedingly convinced that the amount of assertion-like checks in a piece of code is a good indicator of the programmer&rsquo;s expertise.</p>

<p>Bazel&rsquo;s original raison d&rsquo;etre was to support Google&rsquo;s monorepo. A consequence of using a monorepo is that some builds will become very large. And large builds can be very resource hungry, especially when using a tool like Bazel that tries to parallelize as many actions as possible for efficiency reasons. There are many resource types in a system, but today I&rsquo;d like to focus on the number of open files at any given time (nofiles).</p>

<p>Blaze—the variant of Bazel used internally at Google—was originally designed to build the Google monorepo. One of the beauties of sticking to a monorepo is code reuse, but this has the unfortunate side-effect of dependency bloat. As a result, Bazel and Blaze have evolved to support ever-increasingly-bigger pieces of software.
The growth of the projects built by Bazel and Blaze has had the unsurprising consequence that our engineers all now have high-end workstations with access to massive amounts of distributed resources.</p>

The goal of sandboxfs in the context of Bazel is to improve the performance of builds when action sandboxing is enabled.</p>

<p>In part 1 of this series, I made the case that you should run away from the shell when writing integration tests for your software and that you should embrace the primary language of your project to write those.
Depending on the language you are using, doing this will mean significant more work upfront to lay out the foundations for your tests, but this work will pay off. You may also feel that the tests could be more verbose than if they were in shell, though that&rsquo;s not necessarily the case.</p>

<p>My latest developer productivity rant thesis is that integration tests should be written in the exact same language as the thing they test. Specifically, not shell.
This theory applies mostly to tests that verify infrastructure software like servers or command line tools. It is too easy to fall into the trap of using the shell because it feels like the natural choice to interact with tools. But I argue that this is a big mistake that hurts the long-term health of the project, and once trapped, it&rsquo;s hard to escape.</p>

<p>sandboxfs is a FUSE-based file system that exposes an arbitrary view of the host&rsquo;s file system under the mount point, and offers access controls that differ from those of the host. You can think of sandboxfs as an advanced version of bindfs (or mount --bind or mount_null(8) depending on your system) in which you can combine and nest directories under an arbitrary layout.
The primary use case for this project is to provide a better file system sandboxing technique for the Bazel build system.</p>

<p>It has been over 6 years since I joined Google and throughout this time I have been in the Storage SRE family: first with GFS, then with Colossus, and last with Persistent Disk. Even though this counts as 3 different teams, the reality is that I have been doing mostly the same type of work all around.
I had pondered the idea of switching to a pure Software Engineer (SWE) role for all these years and never taken any action. Until now. Things change, and the time has come for me to make a move and pursue that thought in an effort to grow in a different direction. And why now, you ask? Well, simply because I have found a role in the NYC office for a project that I am personally passionate about.

However, Bazel currently has some shortcomings to cater to a certain kind of important projects in the open source ecosystem: the projects that form the foundation of open source operating systems.</p>
