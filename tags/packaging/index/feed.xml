I
started contributing to this packaging system when I first tried NetBSD
in 2001 by sending new packages for small tools, and I later became a
very active contributor while maintaining the GNOME packages. My active
involvement came to an end a few years ago when I switched to OS X, but
I still maintain a few packages and use pkgsrc in my multiple machines:
a couple of NetBSD systems and 3 OS X machines.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SoC: A quote</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/06/soc-quote.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2007 10:54:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/06/soc-quote.html</guid><description>I've already spent a bunch of time working on the packaging (as in what will end up in the .tar.gz distribution files) of &lt;a href="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/atf/">atf&lt;/a> even though it is still in very preliminary stages of development. This involved:&lt;br />&lt;ul>&lt;li>Preparing a clean and nice build framework, which due to the tools I'm using meant writing the &lt;tt>configure.ac&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>Makefile.am&lt;/tt> files. This involved adding some useful comments and, despite I'm familiar with these tools, &lt;i>re-reading&lt;/i> part of the &lt;a href="http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html">GNU Automake&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/">GNU Autoconf&lt;/a> manuals; this last step is something that many, many developers bypass and therefore end up with really messy scripts as if they weren't important. (Read: if the package used some other tools, there'd be no reason to not write pretty and clean build files.)&lt;br />&lt;/li>&lt;li>Preparing the package's documentation, or at least placeholders for it: I'm referring to the typical &lt;tt>AUTHORS&lt;/tt>, &lt;tt>COPYING&lt;/tt>, &lt;tt>NEWS&lt;/tt>, &lt;tt>README&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>TODO&lt;/tt> documents that many developers seem to treat as garbage and fill them up at the last minute before flushing out a release, ending with badly formatted texts full of typos. Come on, that's the very first thing a user will see after unpacking a distribution file, so these ought to be pretty!&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>Having spent a lot of time packaging software for &lt;a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc&lt;/a> and dealing with source code from other projects, I have to say that I've found dozens of packages that do not have the minimum quality one can expect in the above points. I don't like to pinpoint, but I have to: this includes several GNOME packages and the libspe. This last one is fairly "interesting" because the user documentation for it is high-quality, but all the credibility slips away when you look at the source code packaging...&lt;br />&lt;br />To all those authors:&lt;br />&lt;blockquote>“Programs should be written and polished until they acquire publication quality.” &amp;mdash; Niklaus Wirth&lt;/blockquote></description></item></channel></rss>
