      <description>Welcome back! Let&amp;rsquo;s continue the previous post on my reasons for moving from Google to Microsoft by looking at my whole interviewing process.

In the title of this post is a verbatim quote of something I have been told many times throughout the years:
 Your English is pretty good!</description>
