The blog is named after a famous TV show filmed in this same city; I haven't watched the show myself, but I bet that there is no dirt to be seen in it. If you are wondering what the city really looks like, this blog is your place.&lt;br />&lt;br />But, before visiting the blog, be sure to take it as it is meant to be: just a fun collection of photos! If you ever want to visit NYC, don't let the contents of the blog change your plans. You will definitely enjoy your visit regardless.&lt;br />&lt;br />Without further ado, and just in case you missed the link above, &lt;a href="http://dirtandthecity.blogspot.com/">click here to visit Dirt and the City&lt;/a>.</description></item><item><title>Me @ deviantART</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/09/me-deviantart.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2007 11:12:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/09/me-deviantart.html</guid><description>I have been a &lt;a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">deviantART&lt;/a> member for a bit more than three years already &amp;mdash; wow, time passes fast... too fast &amp;mdash;, but I never submitted any stuff I was really proud of. In fact, I have just removed the three deviations I had in my account.&lt;br />&lt;br />Now that I own a decent digital camera, I think I'll start posting some of the photos I like most in that place after retouching them a bit. I don't know if I'll keep up with this, but I'm optimist right now ;-) Feel free to dive into &lt;a href="http://jmmv.deviantart.com/">my member page&lt;/a> and see the two photos I posted!&lt;br />&lt;br />"Why not Flickr?", I hear. At the moment I think I won't be posting lots of photos nor personal ones; that is, not full photo rolls and not photos of me nor any other person I know. Hence deviantART seems a better place to share my "selected" stuff.</description></item><item><title>New camera (and current desktop)</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/09/new-camera-and-current-desktop.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 2007 08:17:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/09/new-camera-and-current-desktop.html</guid><description>After some time complaining about the slowness, the size and the non-working zoom of my old camera, a Kodak Easyshare DX4530 that my father gave me when replacing it, I am now a proud owner of a Canon PowerShot A570 IS. This is my first "decent" digital camera, and I'm looking forward to learning the basics of photography with it.&lt;br />&lt;br />This camera is bigger than what I planned — it is not much smaller than the Kodak —, but, on the other hand, it offers lots of features worth having. To mention some: it has good lens quality, complete manual controls, optical image stabilization, a standard optical zoom (4x) and a very intuitive and easy-to-manage interface (but, of course, this last point is my personal opinion).&lt;br />&lt;br />I thought I could share some pictures of the mess my desktop currently is &amp;mdash. OK, OK, maybe it's not that messy; I have seen photos depicting much worse scenarios than this one. I wish mine could be similar to &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/glennwolsey/767801073/in/set-72157600744490072/">this one&lt;/a>, powered by a huge Apple Cinema Display and a Mac Pro, but I'm not there (yet!) ;-) The laptop and the desire to hack NetBSD on old computers makes keeping things tidy hard.&lt;br />&lt;br />So here we go: this is the main view, where you can easily see the MacBook Pro, an old Apple keyboard to the left and a relatively old PC on the right-low corner, connected to an old flat screen seen at the top-right corner. There is also too much garbage on top of the table that should not really be there: batteries, the speakers, papers... scissors?&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xLbGV919cEE/Rtv-MwjJcmI/AAAAAAAAABc/BQrXAiycqaM/s1600-h/IMG_0100.JPG">&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://jmmv.dev/images/2007-09-03-IMG_0100.JPG" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />And here you can see the "vintage corner", currently composed of a couple of old Macintoshes (68040-powered) and a DNARD (also known as a "shark"). There are also a couple of USB hard disks, but those are not old ;-)&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xLbGV919cEE/Rtv-NAjJcnI/AAAAAAAAABk/PBhR1Eman4c/s1600-h/IMG_0101.JPG">&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="https://jmmv.dev/images/2007-09-03-IMG_0101.JPG" />&lt;/a></description></item><item><title>Death star!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/07/star-of-death.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jul 2007 15:50:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/07/star-of-death.html</guid><description>A cool photo I found today:&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1160/859756472_91daf86593.jpg?v=0">&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px;" src="https://jmmv.dev/images/2007-07-21-859756472_91daf86593.jpg" alt="" border="0" />&lt;/a>&lt;br />I think I can say: don't be scared! That seems to be a power adapter so, supposedly, all those plugs are switched off when one of them is connected. If they weren't... this would not pass any quality assurance control... So, it is a pretty nice product :-)&lt;br />&lt;br />See the &lt;a href="http://www.barisione.org/blog.html/p=94">original post&lt;/a> for more details.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit (23rd July)&lt;/span>: Corrected the (invented) title.</description></item><item><title>Fixing EXIF date information</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/04/fixing-exif-date-information.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Apr 2007 12:21:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/04/fixing-exif-date-information.html</guid><description>Back in February, some friends and I spent a week visiting Punta Cana. We made a lot of photos there but, when we came back, we realized that most of us (not all!) forgot to adjust our camera's date to the foreign timezone, which was 5 hours behind of ours.&lt;br />&lt;br />I imported all our photos in iPhoto but the difference in their timestamps made all images appear unsorted in the main view; this was very annoying. So I wondered if the EXIF information embedded in them could be easily fixed. It turns out it is possible, but the tools to do so — or at least the one I used — leave a lot to be desired: it was not exactly trivial to resolve the problem.&lt;br />&lt;br />In order to modify the EXIF information, I installed the free &lt;a href="http://libexif.sourceforge.net/">libexif&lt;/a> library alongside a very simple frontend to it named &lt;tt>exif&lt;/tt>, distributed from the same page. To painlessly get this in Mac OS X, just use the &lt;tt>graphics/exif&lt;/tt> package in &lt;a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc&lt;/a>.&lt;br />&lt;br />Then I had to see which fields I wanted to modify in each photo. This can be accomplished with the &lt;tt>exif --tag &amp;lt;photo-name.jpg&amp;gt;&lt;/tt> command, which shows all tags currently attached to the photo and their corresponding values. Skimming through the resulting list, it is easy to spot which fields correspond to date information. I specifically picked up &lt;tt>0x0132&lt;/tt>, &lt;tt>0x9003&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>0x9004&lt;/tt>, but some of them may not exist in your images.&lt;br />&lt;br />With this information at hand, I wrote a little script that looped over all affected photos and, for each tag, adjusted it to the new value. It goes as follows:&lt;pre>#!/bin/sh&lt;br />&lt;br />while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do&lt;br /> file=$1; shift&lt;br />&lt;br /> for tag in 0x0132 0x9003 0x9004; do&lt;br /> date=$(exif --tag=${tag} $file | grep Value | &lt;br /> cut -d ' ' -f 4-)&lt;br /> date=$(perl adjust.pl "${date}")&lt;br /> exif --tag=${tag} --ifd=0 --set-value="${date}" ${file}&lt;br /> mv ${file}.modified.jpeg ${file}&lt;br /> done&lt;br />done&lt;/pre>The magic to subtract five hours to each date is hidden in the &lt;tt>adjust.pl&lt;/tt> script, which looks like this:&lt;pre>($date, $time) = split / /, $ARGV[0];&lt;br />&lt;br />($year, $month, $day) = split /:/, $date;&lt;br />($hour, $min, $sec) = split /:/, $time;&lt;br />$amount = 5;&lt;br />if ($hour >= $amount) {&lt;br /> $hour -= $amount;&lt;br />} else {&lt;br /> $hour = $hour - $amount + 24;&lt;br /> if ($day == 1) {&lt;br /> $day = 31;&lt;br /> $month -= 1;&lt;br /> } else {&lt;br /> $day -= 1;&lt;br /> }&lt;br />}&lt;br />&lt;br />printf "%04d:%02d:%02d %02d:%02d:%02dn",&lt;br /> $year, $month, $day, $hour, $min, $sec;&lt;/pre>I know the code is really crappy but it did the job just fine!</description></item></channel></rss>
