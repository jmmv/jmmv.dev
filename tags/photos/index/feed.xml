      <description>A friend of mine recently started a blog called Dirt and the City and, because he has invited me to contribute to it, I feel like posting a reference here ;-)
Dirt and the City is a blog that intends to show you the &#34;ugly&#34; (literally) side of NYC. The blog is named after a famous TV show filmed in this same city; I haven&#39;t watched the show myself, but I bet that there is no dirt to be seen in it.</description>

      <title>Me @ deviantART</title>

      <description>I have been a deviantART member for a bit more than three years already &amp;mdash; wow, time passes fast... too fast &amp;mdash;, but I never submitted any stuff I was really proud of. In fact, I have just removed the three deviations I had in my account.
Now that I own a decent digital camera, I think I&#39;ll start posting some of the photos I like most in that place after retouching them a bit.</description>

      <title>New camera (and current desktop)</title>

      <description>After some time complaining about the slowness, the size and the non-working zoom of my old camera, a Kodak Easyshare DX4530 that my father gave me when replacing it, I am now a proud owner of a Canon PowerShot A570 IS. This is my first &#34;decent&#34; digital camera, and I&#39;m looking forward to learning the basics of photography with it.
This camera is bigger than what I planned — it is not much smaller than the Kodak —, but, on the other hand, it offers lots of features worth having.</description>

      <title>Death star!</title>

      <description>A cool photo I found today:

I think I can say: don&#39;t be scared! That seems to be a power adapter so, supposedly, all those plugs are switched off when one of them is connected. If they weren&#39;t... this would not pass any quality assurance control... So, it is a pretty nice product :-)
See the original post for more details.
Edit (23rd July): Corrected the (invented) title. </description>

      <title>Fixing EXIF date information</title>

      <description>Back in February, some friends and I spent a week visiting Punta Cana. We made a lot of photos there but, when we came back, we realized that most of us (not all!) forgot to adjust our camera&#39;s date to the foreign timezone, which was 5 hours behind of ours.
I imported all our photos in iPhoto but the difference in their timestamps made all images appear unsorted in the main view; this was very annoying.</description>
