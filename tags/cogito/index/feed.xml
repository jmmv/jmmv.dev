      <description>I&#39;ve been using Git (or better said Cogito) recently as part of my PFC and, although I don&#39;t like the way Git was started, I must confess I like it a lot. In some ways it is very similar to Monotone (the version control system I prefer now) but it has its own features that make it very interesting. One of these is the difference between local and remote branches, something I&#39;ll talk about in a future post.</description>
