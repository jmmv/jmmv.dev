In some ways it is very similar to &lt;a href="http://monotone.ca/">Monotone&lt;/a> (the version control system I prefer now) but it has its own features that make it very interesting. One of these is the difference between local and remote branches, something I'll talk about in a future post.&lt;br />&lt;br />For now I would just like to point you to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8">a talk about Git by Linus given at Google&lt;/a>. He focuses more on general concepts of distributed version systems than on Git itself, so most of the ideas given there apply to many other systems as well. If you still don't see the advantages of distributed VCSs over centralized ones, you must watch this. Really. Oh, and it is quite "funny" too ;-)</description></item></channel></rss>
