I recorded a couple of crappy videos in 5 minutes, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmmv/status/1671670996921896960">posted them on a Twitter thread&lt;/a>, and went viral with 8.8K likes at this point. I really could not have predicted that, given that I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting what-I-believe-is interesting content for years and&amp;hellip; nothing, almost-zero interest. Now that things have cooled down, it&amp;rsquo;s time to stir the pot and elaborate on those thoughts a bit more rationally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To summarize, the Twitter thread shows two videos: one of an old computer running Windows NT 3.51 and one of a new computer running Windows 11. In each video, I opened and closed a command prompt, File Explorer, Notepad, and Paint. You can clearly see how apps on the old computer open up instantly whereas apps on the new computer show significant lag as they load. I questioned how computers are actually getting better when trivial things like this have regressed. And boom, the likes and reshares started coming in. Obviously some people had issues with my claims, but there seems to be an overwhelming majority of people that agree we have a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To open up, I&amp;rsquo;ll stand my ground: latency in modern computer interfaces, with modern OSes and modern applications, is terrible and getting worse. This applies to smartphones as well. At the same time, while UIs were much more responsible on computers of the past, those computers were also awful in many ways: new systems have changed our lives substantially. So, what gives?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.10: Core language, evolved</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/12/endbasic-0.10.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 16:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/12/endbasic-0.10.html</guid><description>After three months of early-morning hacking, I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to announce that EndBASIC 0.10 is now available&amp;mdash;right on time for some holiday-time experimentation!
This release marks a huge milestone because it makes the language usable for real-world development.
You see, when I started this project over two years ago, I wrote a rudimentary interpreter for something that resembled BASIC and then launched EndBASIC 0.1. Since then, I have been piling onto those insufficient foundations by adding flashy features such as a web interface, a cloud file sharing service, and a hybrid text/graphics console.</description></item><item><title>Farewell, Microsoft; hello, Snowflake!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/10/bye-microsoft-hi-snowflake.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 07:25:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/10/bye-microsoft-hi-snowflake.html</guid><description>After two years, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a change: I left Microsoft last week and I&amp;rsquo;m starting at Snowflake today.

The borrow checker, preferred idioms and design patterns, the meaning of core traits&amp;hellip; these are all things one must learn before being proficient with the language and able to write code with ease. So, yes, Rust is hard, but does it matter in practical terms? Can we expect large-ish teams to succeed when adopting the language? I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that it does not matter much and that some initial difficulties in bringing people up to speed can pay off in the medium term.</description></item><item><title>Rust traits and dependency injection</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/04/rust-traits-and-dependency-injection.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 09:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/04/rust-traits-and-dependency-injection.html</guid><description>Dependency injection is one of my favorite design patterns to develop highly-testable and modular code. Unfortunately, applying this pattern by taking Rust traits as arguments to public functions has unintended consequences on the visibility of private symbols. If you are not careful, most of your crate-internal APIs might need to become public just because you needed to parameterize a function with a trait. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at why this happens and what we can do about it.</description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Introduction</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>A bit over a week ago, I narrated &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/my-story-with-windows.html">my decades-long love and hate relationship with Windows&lt;/a>. Today, it&amp;rsquo;s time to &lt;em>start&lt;/em> covering my impressions of this platform after spending a year on it as my primary OS. This is noteworthy because I had been a Unix-only person for about 25 years and spent the last 15 on macOS alone. Switching to Windows 10 and 11 has been quite a change and&amp;hellip; for the most part, a positive one. I like what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Always be quitting</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/04/always-be-quitting.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/04/always-be-quitting.html</guid><description>&lt;p>A good philosophy to live by at work is to &amp;ldquo;always be quitting&amp;rdquo;.

If mended properly, they enable a level of uniformity and code quality that is hard to achieve otherwise. If left unattended, however, they become unmanageable monsters of tangled dependencies, slow builds, and frustrating developer experiences. Whether you have a good or bad experience directly depends on the level of engineering support behind the monorepo. Simply put, monorepos require dedicated teams and tools to run nicely. In this post, I will look at how almost-perfect caching plays a key role in keeping build times manageable under such an environment.</description></item><item><title>How does Google avoid clean builds?</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/google-no-clean-builds.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 09:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/google-no-clean-builds.html</guid><description>During my 11 years at Google, I can confidently count the number of times I had to do a &amp;ldquo;clean build&amp;rdquo; with one hand: their build system is so robust that incremental builds always work. Phrases like &amp;ldquo;clean everything and try building from scratch&amp;rdquo; are unheard of. So&amp;hellip; you can color me skeptical when someone says that incremental build problems are due to bugs in the build files and not due to a suboptimal build system. The answer lies in having a robust build system, and in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll examine the common causes behind incremental build breakages, what the build system can do to avoid them, and how Bazel accomplishes most of them.</description></item><item><title>Unit-testing a console app (a text editor)</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/unit-testing-a-console-app.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 10:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/unit-testing-a-console-app.html</guid><description>The most notable feature in EndBASIC 0.3 is its new full-screen console-based text editor. In this post, I describe why it is important and useful to unit-test a console app like this, and I will dive into how to implement unit tests that catch regressions and inefficiencies. Code samples are in Rust, but the concepts presented here are applicable to any language with minimal data abstraction facilities.</description></item><item><title>Windows Subsystem for Linux: The lost potential</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/wsl-lost-potential.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2020 07:50:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/wsl-lost-potential.html</guid><description>If you have followed Windows 10 at all during the last few years, you know that the Windows Subsystem for Linux, or WSL for short, is the hot topic among developers. You can finally run your Linux tooling on Windows as a first class citizen, which means you no longer have to learn PowerShell or, god forbid, suffer through the ancient CMD.EXE console.
Unfortunately, not everything is as rosy as it sounds.</description></item><item><title>Farewell, Google; hello, Microsoft!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/bye-google-hi-microsoft.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 06:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/bye-google-hi-microsoft.html</guid><description>After a little over 11 years, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a much longed change: I&amp;rsquo;m leaving Google and I&amp;rsquo;m joining Microsoft as a Principal Software Engineer for Azure.

Like the former, EndBASIC intends to provide an interactive environment that seamlessly merges coding with immediate visual feedback. Like the latter, EndBASIC offers higher-level programming constructs and strong typing. The main idea behind EndBASIC is to provide a playground for learning the foundations of programming in a simplified environment.</description></item><item><title>Ensuring system rewrites are truly necessary</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/01/system-rewrites-and-tuning.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 17:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/01/system-rewrites-and-tuning.html</guid><description>You probably know that software rewrites, while very tempting, are expensive and can be the mistake that kills a project or a company. Yet they are routinely proposed as the solution to all problems. Is there anything you can do to minimize the risk? In this post, I propose that you actively improve the old system to ensure the new system cannot make progress in a haphazard way. This forces the new system to be designed in such a way that delivers breakthrough improvements and not just incremental improvements.</description></item></channel></rss>
