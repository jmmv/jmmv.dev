I recorded a couple of crappy videos in 5 minutes, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmmv/status/1671670996921896960">posted them on a Twitter thread&lt;/a>, and went viral with 8.8K likes at this point. I really could not have predicted that, given that I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting what-I-believe-is interesting content for years and&amp;hellip; nothing, almost-zero interest. Now that things have cooled down, it&amp;rsquo;s time to stir the pot and elaborate on those thoughts a bit more rationally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To summarize, the Twitter thread shows two videos: one of an old computer running Windows NT 3.51 and one of a new computer running Windows 11. In each video, I opened and closed a command prompt, File Explorer, Notepad, and Paint. You can clearly see how apps on the old computer open up instantly whereas apps on the new computer show significant lag as they load. I questioned how computers are actually getting better when trivial things like this have regressed. And boom, the likes and reshares started coming in. Obviously some people had issues with my claims, but there seems to be an overwhelming majority of people that agree we have a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To open up, I&amp;rsquo;ll stand my ground: latency in modern computer interfaces, with modern OSes and modern applications, is terrible and getting worse. This applies to smartphones as well. At the same time, while UIs were much more responsible on computers of the past, those computers were also awful in many ways: new systems have changed our lives substantially. So, what gives?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.10: Core language, evolved</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/12/endbasic-0.10.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 16:30:00 +0100</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/12/endbasic-0.10.html</guid><description>&lt;p>After three months of early-morning hacking, I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to announce that EndBASIC 0.10 is now available&amp;mdash;right on time for some holiday-time experimentation!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This release marks a &lt;em>huge&lt;/em> milestone because it makes the language usable for real-world development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You see, when I started this project over two years ago, I wrote a rudimentary interpreter for something that resembled BASIC and then launched EndBASIC 0.1. Since then, I have been piling onto those insufficient foundations by adding flashy features such as &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/endbasic-0.3.html">a web interface&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/07/endbasic-0.7.html">a cloud file sharing service&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2021/11/endbasic-0.8.html">a hybrid text/graphics console&lt;/a>. These features have been well-received in every demo I&amp;rsquo;ve given but&amp;hellip; the feedback that always came back was the same: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Give me some sort of functions or subroutines!&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>This is no BASIC without &lt;code>GOTO&lt;/code>!&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And these criticisms were right. Trying to write any sort of non-trivial program in EndBASIC was a daunting and frustrating experience. I had tried to simplify coding to the foundations of structured programming, but without a way to perform unstructured jumps (aka go-tos) or define custom functions&amp;hellip; it was impossible to factor out common code, which is a need for the vast majority of programs that exceed a screenful of text. There were also usability deficits such as the lack of line numbers in error messages, which made it incredibly difficult to debug any failing program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The situation had to change, and change it has in EndBASIC 0.10.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Farewell, Microsoft; hello, Snowflake!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/10/bye-microsoft-hi-snowflake.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 07:25:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/10/bye-microsoft-hi-snowflake.html</guid><description>After two years, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a change: I left Microsoft last week and I&amp;rsquo;m starting at Snowflake today.

The borrow checker is the first boss you must defeat, but with a good mental model of how memory works, how objects move, and the rules that the borrow checker enforces, it becomes second nature rather quickly. These rules may sound complicated, but really, they are about understanding the fundamentals of how a computer works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said&amp;hellip; the difficulties don&amp;rsquo;t stop there. Oh no. As you continue to learn about the language and start dealing with things like concurrency&amp;mdash;or, God forbid, Unix signals&amp;mdash;things can get tricky very quickly. To make matters worse, mastering &lt;a href="https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/intro.html">idiomatic Rust&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/04/rust-into-trait.html">the purpose of core traits&lt;/a> takes a lot of time. I&amp;rsquo;ve had to throw my arms up in frustration a few times so far and, while I&amp;rsquo;ve emerged from those exercises as a better programmer, I have to concede that they were exhausting experiences. And I am certainly not an expert yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, yes, there is no denying in saying that Rust is harder than other languages. But&amp;hellip; does it matter in practical terms?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines">Betteridge&amp;rsquo;s law of headlines&lt;/a> says that we should conclude the post right here with a &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and I think that&amp;rsquo;s the right answer. But let&amp;rsquo;s see why.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rust traits and dependency injection</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/04/rust-traits-and-dependency-injection.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2022 09:30:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/04/rust-traits-and-dependency-injection.html</guid><description>Dependency injection is one of my favorite design patterns to develop highly-testable and modular code. Unfortunately, applying this pattern by taking Rust traits as arguments to public functions has unintended consequences on the visibility of private symbols. If you are not careful, most of your crate-internal APIs might need to become public just because you needed to parameterize a function with a trait. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at why this happens and what we can do about it.</description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Introduction</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>A bit over a week ago, I narrated &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/my-story-with-windows.html">my decades-long love and hate relationship with Windows&lt;/a>. Today, it&amp;rsquo;s time to &lt;em>start&lt;/em> covering my impressions of this platform after spending a year on it as my primary OS. This is noteworthy because I had been a Unix-only person for about 25 years and spent the last 15 on macOS alone. Switching to Windows 10 and 11 has been quite a change and&amp;hellip; for the most part, a positive one. I like what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Always be quitting</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/04/always-be-quitting.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/04/always-be-quitting.html</guid><description>&lt;p>A good philosophy to live by at work is to &amp;ldquo;always be quitting&amp;rdquo;.

If mended properly, they enable a level of uniformity and code quality that is hard to achieve otherwise. If left unattended, however, they become unmanageable monsters of tangled dependencies, slow builds, and frustrating developer experiences. Whether you have a good or bad experience directly depends on the level of engineering support behind the monorepo. Simply put, monorepos require dedicated teams and tools to run nicely. In this post, I will look at how almost-perfect caching plays a key role in keeping build times manageable under such an environment.</description></item><item><title>How does Google avoid clean builds?</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/google-no-clean-builds.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 09:30:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/google-no-clean-builds.html</guid><description>During my 11 years at Google, I can confidently count the number of times I had to do a &amp;ldquo;clean build&amp;rdquo; with one hand: their build system is so robust that incremental builds always work. Phrases like &amp;ldquo;clean everything and try building from scratch&amp;rdquo; are unheard of. So&amp;hellip; you can color me skeptical when someone says that incremental build problems are due to bugs in the build files and not due to a suboptimal build system. The answer lies in having a robust build system, and in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll examine the common causes behind incremental build breakages, what the build system can do to avoid them, and how Bazel accomplishes most of them.</description></item><item><title>Unit-testing a console app (a text editor)</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/unit-testing-a-console-app.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 10:00:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/unit-testing-a-console-app.html</guid><description>The most notable feature in EndBASIC 0.3 is its new full-screen console-based text editor.

Code samples are in Rust, but the concepts presented here are applicable to any language with minimal data abstraction facilities.</description></item><item><title>Windows Subsystem for Linux: The lost potential</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/wsl-lost-potential.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2020 07:50:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/wsl-lost-potential.html</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have followed Windows 10 at all during the last few years, you know that the &lt;strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux&lt;/strong>, or &lt;strong>WSL&lt;/strong> for short, is &lt;em>the&lt;/em> hot topic among developers. You can finally run your Linux tooling on Windows as a first class citizen, which means you no longer have to learn PowerShell or, god forbid, suffer through the ancient &lt;code>CMD.EXE&lt;/code> console.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, not everything is as rosy as it sounds. I now have to do development &lt;em>on&lt;/em> Windows &lt;em>for&lt;/em> Windows as part of my new role within Azure&amp;hellip; and the fact that WSL continues to be separate from the native Windows environment shows. Even though I was quite hopeful, I cannot use WSL as my daily driver because I need to interact with &amp;ldquo;native&amp;rdquo; Windows tooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe things needn&amp;rsquo;t be this way, but with the recent push for WSL 2, I think that the potential of an alternate world is now gone. But what do I mean with this? For that, we must first understand the differences between WSL 1 and WSL 2 and how the push for WSL 2 may shut some interesting paths.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Farewell, Google; hello, Microsoft!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/bye-google-hi-microsoft.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Oct 2020 06:00:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/bye-google-hi-microsoft.html</guid><description>After a little over 11 years, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a much longed change: I&amp;rsquo;m leaving Google and I&amp;rsquo;m joining Microsoft as a Principal Software Engineer for Azure.

Like the latter, EndBASIC offers higher-level programming constructs and strong typing. The main idea behind EndBASIC is to provide a playground for learning the foundations of programming in a simplified environment.</description></item><item><title>Ensuring system rewrites are truly necessary</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/01/system-rewrites-and-tuning.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 17:10:00 +0000</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/01/system-rewrites-and-tuning.html</guid><description>You probably know that software rewrites, while very tempting, are expensive and can be the mistake that kills a project or a company. Yet they are routinely proposed as the solution to all problems. Is there anything you can do to minimize the risk? In this post, I propose that you actively improve the old system to ensure the new system cannot make progress in a haphazard way. This forces the new system to be designed in such a way that delivers breakthrough improvements and not just incremental improvements.</description></item></channel></rss>
