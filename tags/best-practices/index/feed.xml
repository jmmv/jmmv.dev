&lt;p>&lt;strong>Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if you could witness how an experienced developer manages the tools of the craft so that you could draw ideas and incorporate them into your own workflow?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>This post aims to answer the above for the type of work I do by sharing how my workflow looks like. I want to compel you to share your own story in the comments section, and by doing so, create a collection of stories so that others can benefit from them.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to commit a code hack and not perish along the way</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2015/06/how-to-commit-a-code-hack.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2015 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2015/06/how-to-commit-a-code-hack.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>You are the developer in charge to resolve a problem and have prepared a &lt;em>&lt;a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.advanced.changelists.html">changelist&lt;/a>&lt;/em> to fix the bug. You need the changelist to be reviewed by someone else before checkin. Your changelist &lt;em>is&lt;/em> an ugly hack.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What kind of response are you gonna get from your reviewer? Well as with everything: &lt;em>it depends!&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>clearly stated upfront that the changelist &lt;em>is&lt;/em> a hack,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>explained &lt;em>how&lt;/em> it is a hack,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;em>justified&lt;/em> that the hack is the right thing to do at this moment, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>outlined what the &lt;em>real solution&lt;/em> to get rid of the hack would be&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;em>then&lt;/em> your reviewer will most likely just accept the change without fuss (!) and will proceed to review its contents per se. But if you miss &lt;em>any&lt;/em> of those steps, then your reviewer is going to be super-critical about your changelist &lt;em>and&lt;/em> any further related changes you may want to commit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get a handle on email subscriptions</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2015/06/get-a-handle-on-email-subscriptions.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2015 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2015/06/get-a-handle-on-email-subscriptions.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Do you have any idea which online services and stores have you given your email address to?

&lt;p>Three years ago, I was not able to answer these two simple questions when I decided to move my email account to our new family-owned domain. Today? I trivially can, and so can you.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
