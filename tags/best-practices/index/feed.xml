      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you best organize your work environment for maximum productivity if you were tasked to develop a type of application you had never developed before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice if you could witness how an experienced developer manages the tools of the craft so that you could draw ideas and incorporate them into your own workflow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 If you have:
 clearly stated upfront that the changelist is a hack, explained how it is a hack, justified that the hack is the right thing to do at this moment, and outlined what the real solution to get rid of the hack would be  then your reviewer will most likely just accept the change without fuss (!</description>
