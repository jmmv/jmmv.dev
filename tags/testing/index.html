And because your project is of moderate size, it almost-certainly builds one or more binaries, at least one of which is a CLI tool. But let&rsquo;s face it: you don&rsquo;t have end-to-end testing for those tools, do you?</p><p>I&rsquo;m <em>sure</em> you have split the binary&rsquo;s <code>main</code> function into its own file so that the rest of the tool can be put in a library, and I&rsquo;m <em>extra-sure</em> that you have unit tests for such library. But&mldr; those tests do little to verify the functionality and quality of the tool <em>as experienced by the end user</em>. Consider: What exactly does the tool print to the console on success? Does it show errors nicely when they happen, or does it dump internal stack traces? How does it handle unknown flags or bad arguments? Is the built-in help message nicely rendered when your terminal is really wide? What if the terminal is narrow?</p><p>You must write end-to-end tests for your tools but, usually, that isn’t easy to do. Until today. Combining shtk with Bazel via the new <code>rules_shtk</code> ruleset makes it trivial to write tests that verify the behavior of your CLI tools&mdash;no matter what language they are written in&mdash;and in this article I’m going to show you how.</p></p><p class=text-muted>November 4, 2023

I could have written a trivial shell script to do it, but instead I reached out for shtk&rsquo;s unit-testing module. I <a href=https://twitter.com/jmmv/status/1710309896670081083>tweeted about it</a> right away to just say that you can, in fact, write tests in shell because lots of developers are skeptical about any script longer than 10 lines of code.</p><p>Interestingly, this reply came through: a pointer to a contemporary, under-development library for writing tests in Bash. Which made me think: &ldquo;Hey, I had already done that years ago&mldr; but nobody knows about it. Gotta fix that with a blog post!&rdquo; But first, I had to bring shtk back from its ashes because I had not touched it for more than 6 years and it wasn&rsquo;t read for show and tell. So I did something that I wanted to do back in the day but never did: I put together <a href=https://shtk.jmmv.dev/>a website for shtk</a> to host its <a href=https://shtk.jmmv.dev/docs.html>reference manual</a> and I fixed a few obvious rough edges.</p><p>With those tweaks out of the way, we come to this article. In here, I want to show you how writing decent tests in shell is entirely possible and how shtk&rsquo;s testing platform provides unique features to do integration testing of CLI apps written in any language.</p></p><p class=text-muted>October 11, 2023

That's partly true, but unfortunately is not the whole story:<br><ul><li>Other projects depend on these build files and thus rely on their behavior. This can either be by just relying on NetBSD having these files installed, or by using the separate <tt>mk-files</tt> package (available e.g. in Fedora). The functionality of the build infrastructure should not regress, or it would break these third-party projects. (Think about these files as having a public API outside of NetBSD.)</li><li>Even if the build of NetBSD is the real test of the functionality of the build infrastructure, the build infrastructure supports dozens of options and tweaks to change its behavior. One would need to rebuild NetBSD tens, if not hundreds of times, each with a different combination of build options, to ensure the files work.</li><li>Lastly, when a new functionality is added to the build infrastructure, it is because some component of the source tree needs such functionality. It may latter happen that this component disappears or stops needing such functionality. The functionality becomes unused by the source tree, and thus can regress unexpectedly (breaking third-party packages or introducing bugs, as mentioned earlier).</li></ul>With this in mind, it's clear that we should have some tests for the <tt>share/mk</tt> files. Unfortunately, that's easier said than done:&nbsp;the files in <tt>share/mk</tt> are extremely complex and expose hundreds, if not thousands, of different behaviors each with its own subtleties. Adding tests for these is hard. The fact that this code that was never designed to be unit-tested doesn't help either.<br><div><br>Regardless, I have just&nbsp;<a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/source-changes/2012/08/26/msg036875.html>submitted some "placeholder" tests</a>&nbsp;to the tree. The major point of these new test programs is&nbsp;to lower the barrier of entry to writing tests for <tt>share/mk</tt> and, therefore, maybe get other people to write some tests. To predicate with the example, I have populated these skeleton test programs with a couple of test cases each, although as you will see they are very trivial tests.<br><br>And, to conclude, why have I done this <i>now</i>? Well: I'm working on integrating Kyua into the source tree and, to make this happen, I need to do a couple of changes to the build infrastructure files. The changes are tricky, so I want to write tests to have some assurance that my modifications work and that, specially, they do not regress over time. Having the placeholder test programs in place makes this much easier, and the real functionality changes easier to review.</div></p><p class=text-muted>August 26, 2012
