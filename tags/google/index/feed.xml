Those accounts are shutting down. The time has come to either pay up or move out, and you should decide what to do ASAP. It took me weeks of active effort to move my and my family&amp;rsquo;s data out of GAFYD and put it back into Google consumer accounts and other non-Google services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is essentially a recollection of my lab notes on what I did. The text is long and haphazard due to the many things to cover. I&amp;rsquo;ll start with a brief explanation of what GAFYD was, what&amp;rsquo;s happening now, and what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with it. After that, I&amp;rsquo;ll sketch what my new setup is and how I succeeded in moving some of the more complex services.

Phrases like &amp;ldquo;clean everything and try building from scratch&amp;rdquo; are unheard of. So&amp;hellip; you can color me skeptical when someone says that incremental build problems are due to bugs in the build files and not due to a suboptimal build system. The answer lies in having a robust build system, and in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll examine the common causes behind incremental build breakages, what the build system can do to avoid them, and how Bazel accomplishes most of them.</description></item><item><title>My interviews with Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/facebook-twitter-microsoft-interviews.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2020 05:30:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/facebook-twitter-microsoft-interviews.html</guid><description>Now that you know about my recent departure from Google, it is time to look into how the whole interviewing process went with all of Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft.

One of the beauties of sticking to a monorepo is code reuse, but this has the unfortunate side-effect of dependency bloat. As a result, Bazel and Blaze have evolved to support ever-increasingly-bigger pieces of software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The growth of the projects built by Bazel and Blaze has had the unsurprising consequence that our engineers all now have high-end workstations with access to massive amounts of distributed resources. And, as you can imagine, this has had an impact in the design of Blaze: many chunks of our codebase can—and do—assume that everyone has powerful hardware. These assumptions break down as soon as you move into Bazel&amp;rsquo;s open source land: while knowing where the product really runs is out of hand, we can safely assume it is certainly being used on slow&lt;em>er&lt;/em> hardware.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preliminary sandboxfs support in Bazel</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/04/preliminary-sandboxfs-support-in-bazel.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Apr 2018 15:30:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/04/preliminary-sandboxfs-support-in-bazel.html</guid><description>&lt;p>During the summer of last year, &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2017/08/introducing-sandboxfs.html">I hosted an intern who implemented sandboxfs&lt;/a>: a FUSE-based file system that exposes an arbitrary view of the host&amp;rsquo;s file system under the mount point. At the end of his internship, we had a functional sandboxfs implementation and some draft patches for integration in Bazel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal of sandboxfs in the context of Bazel is to improve the performance of builds when action sandboxing is enabled. The way in which we try to do so is by replacing the costly process of setting up the file system for each action using symlinks with a file system that does so &amp;ldquo;instantaneously&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stick to your project's core language in your tests</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/03/stick-to-projects-core-language-in-tests.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 10:00:00 +0900</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/03/stick-to-projects-core-language-in-tests.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This post is a short, generalized summary of the preceeding two. I believe those two posts put readers off due to their massive length and the fact that they were seemingly tied to Bazel and Java, thus failing to communicate the larger point I wanted to make.

&lt;p>Depending on the language you are using, doing this will mean significant more work upfront to lay out the foundations for your tests, but this work will pay off. You may also &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> that the tests could be more verbose than if they were in shell, though that&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily the case.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A case for writing Bazel's integration tests in Java, part 1</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/03/bazel-tests-in-java-part-1.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2018 14:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/03/bazel-tests-in-java-part-1.html</guid><description>&lt;p>My latest developer productivity &lt;del>rant&lt;/del> thesis is that &lt;strong>integration tests should be written in the exact same language as the thing they test&lt;/strong>. Specifically, &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> shell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This theory applies mostly to tests that verify infrastructure software like servers or command line tools. It is too easy to fall into the trap of using the shell because it feels like the natural choice to interact with tools. But I argue that this is a big mistake that hurts the long-term health of the project, and once trapped, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to escape.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don't rollback rollbacks</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/03/dont-rollback-rollbacks.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 06:45:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/03/dont-rollback-rollbacks.html</guid><description>&lt;p>In a version control system, &lt;strong>a rollback is a type of change that undoes the effects of a previous commit&lt;/strong>. In essence, a rollback is a commit that applies the inverse diff of another commit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At Google, our tools make it trivial to create rollbacks for a given &lt;em>changelist&lt;/em> or &lt;em>CL&lt;/em>. (A CL is similar to a commit but can be either pending—in review—or submitted.) Making it trivial to create rollback CLs is important in a culture where the standard upon encountering a problem is &amp;ldquo;rollback first, ask questions later&amp;rdquo; because it removes friction from the process of backing out problematic changes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Joining the Blaze team</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2016/01/joining-blaze-team.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2016 08:30:00 -0500</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2016/01/joining-blaze-team.html</guid><description>&lt;p>It has been &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@jmmv/six-years-at-google-8b06563fab08">over 6 years since I joined
Google&lt;/a> and
throughout this time I have been in the Storage SRE family: first with GFS,
then with Colossus, and last with Persistent Disk. Even though this counts as
3 different teams, the reality is that I have been doing mostly the same type
of work all around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had pondered the idea of switching to a pure Software Engineer (SWE) role for
all these years and never taken any action. Until now. Things change, and the
time has come for me to make a move and pursue that thought in an effort to
grow in a different direction. And why now, you ask? Well, simply because I
have found a role in the NYC office for a project that I am personally
passionate about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Six years at Google</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2015/05/six-years-at-google.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2015 12:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2015/05/six-years-at-google.html</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

here, and this post is about Bazel: a tool recently published by Google.
Why? Because I love its internal counterpart, Blaze, and believe that
Bazel has the potential to be one of the best build tools if it is not
already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Bazel currently has some shortcomings to cater to a certain
kind of important projects in the open source ecosystem: the projects
that form the foundation of open source operating systems. This post is,
exclusively, about this kind of project.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
