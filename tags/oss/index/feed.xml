The time to jump ship has come.&lt;/p> &lt;p>The major reason for this move is that &lt;a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html">Google Code stopped supporting file downloads&lt;/a> three weeks ago. This is unfortunate given that "binary" releases are a must for proper software distribution. Sure, I could use a third-party service like &lt;a href="https://bintray.com/">Bintray&lt;/a> to offer the downloads, but I'd rather consolidate all project data in a single location.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Patch management with Quilt</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2013/11/patch-management-with-quilt.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2013 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2013/11/patch-management-with-quilt.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Creating and managing patches on top of a source tree maintained in a
non-distributed VCS needn&amp;rsquo;t be hard. Some people handle this with Git,
but I use a tool that seems to have fallen in disuse but was once very
popular to create patchsets against the Linux kernel:
&lt;a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt">Quilt&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is Quilt? As the quilt(1) manual page says:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>quilt&lt;/strong> - tool to manage series of patches&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quilt is a tool to manage large sets of patches by keeping track of
the changes each patch makes. Patches can be applied, un-applied,
refreshed, etc. The key philosophical concept is that your primary
output is patches.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book: Producing Open Source Software</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2007/07/book-producing-open-source-software.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jul 2007 10:25:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2007/07/book-producing-open-source-software.html</guid><description>This year, Google sent all the Summer of Code students the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;">Producing Open Source Software: How to run a successful free software project&lt;/span> book by Karl Fogel (ISBN 0-596-00759-0) as a welcome present.&lt;br />&lt;br />I've just finished reading it and I can say that it was a very nice read. The book is very easy to follow and is very complete: it covers areas such as the project's start-up, how to set things up for promoting it, how to behave in mailing lists, how to prepare releases, how to deal with volunteers or with paid developers, etc. Everything you need to drive your project correctly and without gaining much enemies.&lt;br />&lt;br />While many of the things stated in the book are obvious to anyone who has been in the open source world for a while (and already started a project on its own or contributed to an existing one), it is still a worthy read. I wish all the people involved in NetBSD (some more than others) read it and applied the suggestions given there. We'd certainly improve in many key areas and reduce pointless (or better said, unpleasant) discussions!&lt;br />&lt;br />Oh, and by the way: you can read the book online at its &lt;a href="http://producingoss.com/">web page&lt;/a>, as it is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. Kudos to Karl Fogel.</description></item></channel></rss>
