We saw &lt;a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2006/08/localcreds-socket-credentials.html">yesterday&lt;/a> multiple details about &lt;tt>LOCAL_CREDS&lt;/tt> socket credentials and, as you may deduce, I missed some.&lt;br />&lt;br />First of all I assumed that setting the &lt;tt>LOCAL_CREDS&lt;/tt> option only affected the next received message (I didn't mention this explicitly in the post though). It turns out that this is incorrect: enabling this option makes the socket transmit credentials information on each message until the option is disabled again.&lt;br />&lt;br />Secondly, setting the &lt;tt>LOCAL_CREDS&lt;/tt> option on a server socket (one configured with the &lt;tt>listen(2)&lt;/tt> call) results in all sockets created from it through &lt;tt>accept(2)&lt;/tt> to also carry the flag enabled. In other words, it is inherited.&lt;br />&lt;br />These features are interesting because, when using combined, avoid the need for the synchronization protocol outlined in the previous post â€” in some cases only. If the credentials are to be transmitted at the very beginning of the connection, the server can follow these steps:&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>Create the server socket and configure it with &lt;tt>bind(2)&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>listen(2)&lt;/tt>.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Before entering the &lt;tt>accept(2)&lt;/tt> loop, set the &lt;tt>LOCAL_CREDS&lt;/tt> option on the server socket.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Enter the &lt;tt>accept(2)&lt;/tt> loop and start accepting clients.&lt;/li>&lt;li>For each new client:&lt;/li>&lt;ol>&lt;li>Receive its first message.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Get the credentials from it.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Disable the &lt;tt>LOCAL_CREDS&lt;/tt> option from the socket used to communicate with that specific client.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;/ol>It couldn't be easier! This is still different to all other socket credentials methods I know of but can be easily adapted to protocols that were not designed to support &lt;tt>LOCAL_CREDS&lt;/tt> (i.e. that do not implement the synchronization explained in the previous post).</description></item><item><title>LOCAL_CREDS socket credentials</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2006/08/localcreds-socket-credentials.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2006 05:55:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2006/08/localcreds-socket-credentials.html</guid><description>&lt;span style="font-style: italic;">Socket credentials&lt;/span> is a feature that allows a user process to receive the credentials (UID, GID, etc.) of the process at the other end of a communication socket in a safe way. The operating system is in charge of managing this information, sent separately from the data flow, so that the user processes cannot fake it. There are many different implementations of this concept out there as you can imagine.&lt;br />&lt;br />For some reason I assumed for a long time that NetBSD didn't support any kind of socket credentials. However, I recently discovered that it indeed supports them through the &lt;tt>LOCAL_CREDS&lt;/tt> socket option. Unfortunately it behaves quite differently from other methods. This poses some annoying portability problems in applications not designed in the first place to support it (e.g. &lt;a href="http://dbus.freedesktop.org/">D-Bus&lt;/a>, the specific program I'm fighting right now).&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;tt>LOCAL_CREDS&lt;/tt> works as follows:&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>The receiver interested in remote credentials uses &lt;tt>setsockopt(2)&lt;/tt> to enable the &lt;tt>LOCAL_CREDS&lt;/tt> option in the socket.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The sender sends a message through the channel either with &lt;tt>write(2)&lt;/tt> or &lt;tt>sendmsg(2)&lt;/tt>. It needn't do anything special other than ensuring that the message is sent &lt;b>after&lt;/b> the receiver has enabled the &lt;tt>LOCAL_CREDS&lt;/tt> option.&lt;/li>&lt;li>The receiver gets the message using &lt;tt>recvmsg(2)&lt;/tt> and parses the out of band data stored in the control buffer: a &lt;tt>struct sockcred&lt;/tt> message that contains the remote credentials (UID, GID, etc.). This does not provide the PID of the remote process though, as other implementations do.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>The tricky part here is to ensure that the sender writes the message after the receiver has enabled the &lt;tt>LOCAL_CREDS&lt;/tt> option. If this is not guaranteed, a race condition appears and the behavior becomes random: some times the receiver will get socket credentials, some times it will not.&lt;br />&lt;br />To ensure this restriction there needs to be some kind of synchronization protocol between the two peers. This is illustrated in the following example: it assumes a client/server model and a "go on" message used to synchronize. The server could do:&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>Wait for client connection.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Set &lt;tt>LOCAL_CREDS&lt;/tt> option on remote socket.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Send a "go on" message to client.&lt;br />&lt;/li>&lt;li>Wait for a response, which carries the credentials.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Parse the credentials.&lt;br />&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>And the client could do:&lt;br />&lt;ol>&lt;li>Connect to server.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Wait until "go on" message.&lt;/li>&lt;li>Send any message to the server.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>To conclude, a sample example program that shows how to manage the &lt;tt>LOCAL_CREDS&lt;/tt> option. &lt;tt>socketpair(2)&lt;/tt> is used for simplicity, but this can easily be extrapolated to two independent programs.&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;pre>#include &amp;lt;sys/param.h&amp;gt;&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;sys/types.h&amp;gt;&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;sys/inttypes.h&amp;gt;&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;sys/socket.h&amp;gt;&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;sys/un.h&amp;gt;&lt;br />&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;err.h&amp;gt;&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt;&lt;br />#include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;&lt;br />&lt;br />int&lt;br />main(void)&lt;br />{&lt;br /> int sv[2];&lt;br /> int on = 1;&lt;br /> ssize_t len;&lt;br /> struct iovec iov;&lt;br /> struct msghdr msg;&lt;br /> struct {&lt;br /> struct cmsghdr hdr;&lt;br /> struct sockcred cred;&lt;br /> gid_t groups[NGROUPS - 1];&lt;br /> } cmsg;&lt;br />&lt;br /> /*&lt;br /> * Create a pair of interconnected sockets for simplicity:&lt;br /> * sv[0] - Receive end (this program).&lt;br /> * sv[1] - Write end (the remote program, theorically).&lt;br /> */&lt;br /> if (socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, sv) == -1)&lt;br /> err(EXIT_FAILURE, "socketpair");&lt;br />&lt;br /> /*&lt;br /> * Enable the LOCAL_CREDS option on the reception socket.&lt;br /> */&lt;br /> if (setsockopt(sv[0], 0, LOCAL_CREDS, &amp;on, sizeof(on)) == -1)&lt;br /> err(EXIT_FAILURE, "setsockopt");&lt;br />&lt;br /> /*&lt;br /> * The remote application writes the message AFTER setsockopt&lt;br /> * has been used by the receiver.
