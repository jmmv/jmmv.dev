      <description>From day one, the Kyua source tree has had docstring annotations for all of its symbols. The goal of such docstrings is to document the code for the developers of Kyua: these docstrings were never intended to turn into pre-generated HTML documentation because Kyua does not offer an API once installed.
As you might have noticed, Doxygen is an optional component of the build and it used to run on each make invocation.</description>
