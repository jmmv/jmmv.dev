This post raises a bunch of concerns on the Go language and is posted from the perspective of someone who prefers Rust. And, just yesterday, I noticed &lt;a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/lies-we-tell-ourselves-to-keep-using-golang">a comment on Twitter by @FiloSottile&lt;/a> that, paraphrased, reads &amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Why is there so much hatred towards Go, especially from Rust developers?&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wish I could answer this question with a &amp;ldquo;no, there isn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo;, but that would be a lie: in any large community, there will certainly be hateful people/opinions. If you have encountered such flamebait, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, and I&amp;rsquo;m not here to defend it. What I&amp;rsquo;m here to do is look at the possible truth behind the claim that Rust developers dislike Go, and I wanted to elaborate on this based on my personal experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rust vs. Go</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2018/07/rust-vs-go.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2018 10:45:00 +0200</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2018/07/rust-vs-go.html</guid><description>There is no good answer to this question: people tend to put Go and Rust in the same bucket because they were released at around the same time, because Rust&amp;rsquo;s release felt like a response to Go&amp;rsquo;s, and because they are marketed to similar audiences. They are, however, vastly different. So let&amp;rsquo;s give in and compare them anyway.</description></item><item><title>A look at Go from a newbie's perspective</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2016/03/golang-review.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2016 17:00:00 -0400</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2016/03/golang-review.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I confess I am late to the game: the &lt;a href="https://golang.org/">Go programming language&lt;/a> came out in 2009 and I had not had the chance to go &lt;em>all in&lt;/em> for a real project until two weeks ago. Here is a summary of my experience. Spoiler alert: I&amp;rsquo;m truly pleased.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-project">The project&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>What I set out to build is a read-only caching file system to try to solve the problems I presented in my previous &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2016/02/sshfs-performance-analysis-for-builds.html">analysis of large builds on SSHFS&lt;/a>. The reasons I chose Go are simple: I had to write a low-level system component and, in theory, Go excels at this; I did not want to use plain C; Go had the necessary bindings (for &lt;a href="https://bazil.org/fuse/">FUSE&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3">SQLite&lt;/a>); and, heck, I &lt;em>just&lt;/em> wanted to try it out!&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2016-03-22-header.png" length="28190" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
