      <description>There is no good answer to this question: people tend to put Go and Rust in the same bucket because they were released at around the same time, because Rust&amp;rsquo;s release felt like a response to Go&amp;rsquo;s, and because they are marketed to similar audiences.  They are, however, vastly different.  So let&amp;rsquo;s give in and compare them anyway.</description>
