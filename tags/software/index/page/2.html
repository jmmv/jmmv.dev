These assumptions break down as soon as you move into Bazel&rsquo;s open source land: while knowing where the product really runs is out of hand, we can safely assume it is certainly being used on slow<em>er</em> hardware.</p></p><p class=text-muted>April 30, 2018

host&rsquo;s file system under the mount point, and offers access controls that
differ from those of the host. You can think of sandboxfs as an advanced
version of <a href=https://bindfs.org/>bindfs</a> (or <code>mount --bind</code> or <code>mount_null(8)</code>
depending on your system) in which you can combine and nest directories under
an arbitrary layout.</p><p>The primary use case for this project is to provide a better file system
sandboxing technique for the Bazel build system. The goal here is to run each
build action (think compiler invocation) in a sandbox so that its inputs and
outputs are tightly controlled, and sandboxfs attempts to do this in a more
efficient manner than the current symlinks-based implementation.</p></p><p class=text-muted>August 25, 2017

the sake of it. I had attempted to do so in short chunks of &ldquo;free time&rdquo;,
but that never played out well: I had to force myself to sit down for a few
hours straight to fight Android Studio and overcome the initial
difficulties in coding for an unknown platform. That&rsquo;s why, during the
last Thanksgiving week, I took three days off of work to focus on writing
my first Android app. The goal was to get a basic app that could later be
built on iteratively as open source. The specifics of the app did not
matter much for this exercise, but I had a simple idea in mind.</p></p><p class=text-muted>December 17, 2015

Unfortunately, the project itself has no mailing list to receive notifications on every commit, and the managers refuse to set this up. They do not see the value of such a list and they are scared of it because they probably assume that <i>everyone</i> ought to be subscribed to it.<br><br>Having worked on projects that have a commit notification mailing list available, I strongly advise to have such a list anytime you have more than one developer working on a project[1]. Bonus points if every commit message comes with a bundled copy of the change's diff (in unified form!). This list <i>must be independent from the regular development mailing list</i> and it <i>must be opt-in</i>: i.e. never subscribe anyone by default, let themselves subscribe if they want to! Not everyone will need to receive this information, but it comes very useful... and it's extremely valuable for the project managers themselves!<br><br>Why is this useful? Being subscribed to the commit notification mailing list, it is extremely easy to know what is going on on the project[2]. It is also really easy to review the code submissions as soon as they are made which, with proper reviews by other developers, <i>trains the authors</i> and improves their skills. And if the revision diff is inlined, it is trivial to pinpoint mistakes in it (be them style errors, subtle bugs, or serious design problems) by replying to the email.<br><br>So, to my current project managers: if you read me, here is a wish-list item. And, for everyone else, if you need to set up a new project, consider creating this mailing list as soon as possible. Maybe few developers will subscribe to it, but those that do will pay attention and will provide very valuable feedback in the form of replies.<br><br>1: Shame on me for not having such a mailing list for ATF. Haven't investigated how to do so with Monotone.<br><br>2: Of course, the developers must be conscious to commit early and often, and to provide well-formed changesets: i.e. self-contained and with descriptive logs.</p><p class=text-muted>May 13, 2009

A year and two months later, it is time to complain again.<br><br>I am thinking on renewing my MacBook Pro assuming I can sell this one for a good price. The reasons for this are to get slightly better hardware (more disk, better GPU and maybe 4GB of RAM) and software updates. The problem is: if I am able to find a buyer, I will be left without a computer for some days, and that's not a good scenario. I certainly don't want to order the new one without being certain that I will be paid enough for the current one.<br><br>So yesterday I started assembling some old components I had lying around aiming at having an old but functional computer to work with. But today I realized that I also had the PlayStation 3 with Fedora 8 already installed, and that it'd be enough to use as a desktop for a week or so. I had trimmed down the installation to the bare minimum so that it'd boot as fast as possible and to leave free resources for testing Cell-related stuff. But if I wanted to use the PS3 as a desktop, I needed, for example, GNOME.<br><br>Ew. Doing a <tt>yum groupinstall "GNOME Desktop Environment"</tt> took quite a while, and not because of the network connection. But even if we leave that aside, starting the environment was painful. <i>Really</i> painful. And Mono was not there, at all! It is amazing how unusable the desktop is with "only" 256MB of RAM; the machine is constantly going to swap, and the disk being slow does not help either. I still remember the days when 256MB was a lot, and desktop machines were snappy enough with only half of that, or even less.<br><br>OK, so GNOME is a lot for 256MB of RAM. I am now writing this from the PS3 itself running WindowMaker. Which unfortunately does not solve all the problems &mdash; and the biggest one is that it is not a desktop environment. Firefox also requires lots of resources to start, and doing something else in the background still makes the machine use swap. (Note that I have disabled almost all of the system services enabled by default in Fedora, including SELinux.)<br><br>If I finally sell my MBP, this will certainly be enough for a few days... but it's a pity to see how unusable it is. (Yeah, by today's standards, the PS3 is extremely short on RAM, I know, but GNOME used to run quite well with this amount of RAM just a few years ago.)</p><p class=text-muted>February 28, 2008

The speed boost I noticed in games, builds and the overall system usage was incredible &mdash; I was coming from a Pentium II 233 with 384MB of RAM.<br><br>With the change, I was finally able to switch from plain window managers to desktop environments (alternating KDE and GNOME from time to time) and still keep a usable machine. I was also able to play the games of that era at high resolutions. And, what benefited me more, the build times of packages and NetBSD itself were cut by more than a half. For example, it previously needed between 6 to 7 hours to do a full NetBSD release build and, after the switch, it barely took 2. On the pkgsrc side, building some packages was almost instantaneous because the machine processed both the infrastructure and the source builds like crazy.<br><br>But time passes and nowadays the machine feels extremely sluggish. And you know that hardware does not degrade like this so it's easy to conclude it's software's fault. (Thank God I've done some upgrades on the hardware, like doubling the memory, replacing the video card and adding a faster hard disk.)<br><br>I'm currently running Kubuntu 6.10 and KDE is desperately slow in some situations; of course GNOME has its critical scenarios too. (Well... it is not <i>that</i> slow, but responsiveness is, and that makes a big amount of the final experience.) The problem is they behaved much better in the past yet I, as a desktop user, haven't noticed any great usability improvement that is worth such speed differences. As a side note: I know the developers of both projects try their best to optimize the code &mdash; kudos to them! &mdash; but this is how I see it in my machine.<br><br>Another data point, this time more objective than the previous one. Remember I mentioned NetBSD took less than 2 hours to build? Guess what. It now takes 5 to 6 hours to build a full release; it's as if I went back in time 3 years! Or take pkgsrc: the infrastructure is now very, very slow; in some packages, it takes more time than the program's build itself.<br><br>I could continue this rant but... it'd drive nowhere. Please do not take it as something against NetBSD, pkgsrc and KDE in particular. I've taken these three projects to illustrate the issue because they are the ones I can compare to the software I used when I bought the machine. I'm sure all other software suffers from slowdowns.<br><br>Anyway, three years seem to be too much for a machine. Sometimes I think developers should be banned fast machines because, usually, they are the ones with the fastest machines. This makes them not notice the slowdowns as much as end users do. Kind of joking.</p><p class=text-muted>December 9, 2006
