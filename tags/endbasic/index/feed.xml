This release marks a huge milestone because it makes the language usable for real-world development.
You see, when I started this project over two years ago, I wrote a rudimentary interpreter for something that resembled BASIC and then launched EndBASIC 0.1. Since then, I have been piling onto those insufficient foundations by adding flashy features such as a web interface, a cloud file sharing service, and a hybrid text/graphics console.</description></item><item><title>From AST to bytecode execution in EndBASIC</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/11/endbasic-bytecode.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 06:50:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/11/endbasic-bytecode.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Since its inception two years ago, the EndBASIC interpreter has been using an AST-based execution
engine. And during all this time, people have mocked the language for not allowing &lt;code>10 GOTO 10&lt;/code>.
Well, fear not: the upcoming 0.10 release has full support for &lt;code>GOTO&lt;/code> and &lt;code>GOSUB&lt;/code>, features that
were made possible by moving to a bytecode-based interpreter. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a peek at what the
problems were and how I addressed them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.9: Run shared demos easily</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/06/endbasic-0.9.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2022 17:20:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/06/endbasic-0.9.html</guid><description>&lt;p>It is with great pleasure that I announce the release of EndBASIC 0.9.0 😎️.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The major feature in this new release is the ability to &lt;strong>launch publicly-shared files via a click of a URL&lt;/strong> without having to create an account first. Here, try running my &lt;a href="https://repl.endbasic.dev/?run=jmmv/bounce.bas">&lt;code>jmmv/bounce.bas&lt;/code>&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://repl.endbasic.dev/?run=jmmv/paint.bas">&lt;code>jmmv/paint.bas&lt;/code>&lt;/a> demos in your browser, now!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.8: Now, with graphics!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/11/endbasic-0.8.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 09:45:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/11/endbasic-0.8.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Graphics support has finally landed in EndBASIC and, with that, the 0.8 release is finally here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This release marks a huge milestone in the development of EndBASIC. Supporting graphics is something I&amp;rsquo;ve had in mind since the very beginning but had been procrastinating on until a couple of months ago. I feared everything that would be involved in delivering this feature, and to be fair, I was right: getting the desktop console to work on all platforms, and especially getting it to work in CI for automated testing, was tedious. But it&amp;rsquo;s done now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.7: Hello, cloud!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/07/endbasic-0.7.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 16:45:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/07/endbasic-0.7.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Several months have passed since the last EndBASIC release and, since then, you might have seen me talk nonstop about an &amp;ldquo;EndBASIC service&amp;rdquo; in social media&amp;hellip; which has sounded like vaporware. That changes today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After about four months of work, I am ecstatic to announce that EndBASIC 0.7 is here. And these haven&amp;rsquo;t been four months of idle time. No, no, no. It has taken four months of my scarce free time to deliver this because 0.7 is a humongous release on various fronts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.6 release announcement</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/02/endbasic-0.6.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/02/endbasic-0.6.html</guid><description>After a very active month of development since the 0.5 announcement, it is time to welcome EndBASIC 0.6!
This new 0.6 release is super-exciting for three reasons:
preliminary GPIO support in the standard library specifically tailored to the Raspberry Pi; multidimensional array support in the language; and availability of binary releases for the most common platforms. You can dive right in by:

This makes it hard to embed those interpreters into other programs because it&amp;rsquo;s not obvious how to limit their side-effects and because the interpreter dependency can be heavy. In this post, we will see how EndBASIC&amp;rsquo;s design tries hard to keep the core as small as possible, and we will see some examples on how to use EndBASIC from Rust and vice versa.</description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.5 release announcement</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/endbasic-0.5.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2021 08:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/endbasic-0.5.html</guid><description>A month has passed since the 0.4.0 announcement so it is about time to say hello to yet another EndBASIC release because 0.5.0 is here! So, what&amp;rsquo;s new? Not much&amp;hellip; unless you look under the covers, in which case a &lt;em>ton&lt;/em> has changed. About 30% of the codebase has been affected in one way or another to improve general quality, so read on to see how.</description></item><item><title>Why am I wasting time on EndBASIC?</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/why-endbasic.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2021 07:10:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/01/why-endbasic.html</guid><description>If you have been following this blog or my social profiles for the last year, you are probably aware that I have been working on something called EndBASIC. You also probably know that this is a retro-looking BASIC interpreter written in Rust that happens to run on the web. And if you know those two things, you are probably wondering, like some of my friends do: why am I wasting time developing such a useless project?</description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.4 release announcement</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/endbasic-0.4.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Dec 2020 19:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/endbasic-0.4.html</guid><description>About a month ago and after a long hiatus, I published EndBASIC 0.3 and the adrenaline rush that came with it got my wheels spinning again full-steam ahead. So here I am today, ready to announce the 0.4 release. But&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;what could have possibly changed in just a month of someone&amp;rsquo;s free time&amp;rdquo;, you wonder? Enough, actually!
EndBASIC 0.4 is the release that fulfills my original goal of being able to run a &amp;ldquo;guess the number&amp;rdquo; game.</description></item><item><title>Unit-testing a console app (a text editor)</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/unit-testing-a-console-app.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 10:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/unit-testing-a-console-app.html</guid><description>The most notable feature in EndBASIC 0.3 is its new full-screen console-based text editor. In this post, I describe why it is important and useful to unit-test a console app like this, and I will dive into how to implement unit tests that catch regressions and inefficiencies. Code samples are in Rust, but the concepts presented here are applicable to any language with minimal data abstraction facilities.</description></item><item><title>Using the builder pattern to define test scenarios</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2020 09:40:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the builder patter to express test scenarios in a succinct and declarative manner. I&amp;rsquo;ve liked the outcome and feel that this design can yield to pretty good test code, so I&amp;rsquo;ll dig through this idea here. Note that, while this post and the associated code talk about Rust, &lt;strong>the ideas presented here apply to any language&lt;/strong>. So don&amp;rsquo;t leave just because I said Rust!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.3 is here</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/endbasic-0.3.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Nov 2020 12:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/endbasic-0.3.html</guid><description>After a 6-month long hiatus caused by me hunting and changing jobs and cities, I am pleased to announce the release of EndBASIC 0.3! The Thanksgiving break has been as fruitful as I had hoped 😁
There are two major changes in this release.
The first is the official debut of the web-based interface. I introduced this months ago and have had it running on a &amp;ldquo;push on green&amp;rdquo; model, which means that the web deployment of EndBASIC is always tracking Git HEAD.</description></item><item><title>Bridging the web gap in EndBASIC</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/bridging-the-web-gap-endbasic.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2020 08:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/bridging-the-web-gap-endbasic.html</guid><description>After a ton of work, a lot of which was unexpected, I am ecstatic to announce that EndBASIC is now a reality on the web! The whole language interpreter can now run as a fully client-side web app on a computer, on a tablet&amp;hellip; and even on a phone. Yes: the whole thing, which is written in Rust (94%), works in a modern browser with just a tiny bit of JavaScript glue (1%).</description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.2.0 is here</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/endbasic-0.2.0.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 06:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/05/endbasic-0.2.0.html</guid><description>A couple of weeks ago, I announced EndBASIC: a simple BASIC language interpreter written in Rust with a goal to provide an environment for teaching my kids how to code. That first release provided what-I-think-is a robust interpreter, but that was about it: the language features were still minimal and the interactive features were non-existent.
Well, EndBASIC 0.2.0 is here and things are changing! It&amp;rsquo;s still far from the vision I want to reach, but it&amp;rsquo;s slowly moving towards that direction.</description></item></channel></rss>
