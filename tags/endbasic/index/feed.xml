      <description>After a ton of work, a lot of which was unexpected, I am ecstatic to announce that EndBASIC is now a reality on the web! The whole language interpreter can now run as a fully client-side web app on a computer, on a tablet&amp;hellip; and even on a phone. Yes: the whole thing, which is written in Rust (94%), works in a modern browser with just a tiny bit of JavaScript glue (1%).</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I announced EndBASIC: a simple BASIC language interpreter written in Rust with a goal to provide an environment for teaching my kids how to code. That first release provided what-I-think-is a robust interpreter, but that was about it: the language features were still minimal and the interactive features were non-existent.
Well, EndBASIC 0.2.0 is here and things are changing! It&amp;rsquo;s still far from the vision I want to reach, but it&amp;rsquo;s slowly moving towards that direction.</description>

      <description>INPUT&amp;#34;Did you ever experience BASIC (true/false)&amp;#34;;answer? IFanswer?THEN PRINT&amp;#34;Great; you are in for a treat!&amp;#34; ELSE PRINT&amp;#34;Oh noes; try today?&amp;#34; ENDIF I have pretty fond memories of my Amstrad CPC 6128 and its Locomotive BASIC 1.1. The experience was quite unique as the computer was ready to take commands in a couple of seconds, and those commands you typed had an immediate effect on the screen. Changing colors, drawing, playing sounds&amp;hellip; were all at your fingertips, which was pretty exciting for a young boy.</description>
