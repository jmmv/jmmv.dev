At first, I modified that module to emit events at certain key points, which were later registered in a circular queue. Then, I implemented a file in <tt>/proc</tt> so that a user-space application could read from it and free space from the queue to prevent the loss of events when it was full.<br><br>That first implementation never worked well, but as I liked how it was evolving, I thought it could be a neat idea to make this "framework" more generic so that other parts of the kernel could use it. I rewrote everything with this idea in mind and then also modified the regular scheduler and the process-management system calls to also rise events for my trace. And got it working.<br><br>But then, I was talking to <a href=http://blogs.nopcode.org/brainstorm/>Brainstorm</a> about his new "Sun Campus Ambassador" position at the University, and during the conversation he mentioned DTrace. So I asked... "Mmm, that tool could probably simplify all my work; is it there something similar for Linux?". And yes; yes it is! Its name, <a href=http://sourceware.org/systemtap/>SystemTap</a>.<br><br>As the web page says, SystemTap "provides an infrastructure to simplify the gathering of information about the running Linux system". You do this by writing small scripts that hook into specific points of the kernel — at the function level, at specific mark points, etc. — and which get executed when the script is processed and installed into the live kernel as a loadable kernel module.<br><br>With this tool I can discard my several-hundred-long changes to gather traces and replace them with some very, very simple SystemTap scripts. No need to rebuild the kernel, no need to deal with custom changes to it, no need to rebuild every now and then... neat!<br><br>Now I'm having problems using the feature that allows to instrument kernel markers, and I need them because otherwise some private functions cannot be instrumented due to compiler optimizations (I think). OK, I'd expose those functions, but while I'm at it, I think it'd be a good idea to write a decent tapset for spufs that could later be published. And that prevents me from doing such hacks.<br><br>But anyway, kudos to the SystemTap developers. I now understand why everybody is so excited about DTrace.</p><p class=text-muted>December 2, 2007

Sorry, had to say it. (If you are one of those who wrote the installer, please excuse me, but that's what I really think. Take this as a constructive criticism.)<br><br>Before saying that Fedora 8 is not supported and that I should only run this on Fedora 7, shut up. I am sure all the problems are there too, because none of them can be related to the system version.<br><br>Strictly speaking, it is not that the installer does not work, because if you follow the instructions it does. But it is a very strange program that leaves garbage all around your system, produces warning messages during execution and the garbage left around will keep producing warnings indefinitely. Plus, to make things worse, the network connection to the BSC &mdash; where the free software packages are downloaded from by yum &mdash; is extremely unreliable from outside the university's direct connection (that is, from home), which means that you will have to retry the installation lots of times until you are able to download all the huge packages. (In fact, that's what annoys me most.) And this is not a problem that happened today only; it also bit me half a year ago when installing the 2.1 version.<br><br>Let's talk about the installer, that marvelous application.<br><br>Starting with version 3, the SDK is composed of a RPM package called <tt>cell-install</tt> and two ISO images (Devel and Extras). When I saw that, I was pretty happy because I thought that, with the RPM package alone, I'd be able to do all the installation without having to deal with ISO images. It turns out that that is not true, as some components only seem to be available from within them (most likely the non-free ones, but I haven't paid attention).<br><br>Ah, you want to know what the SDK contains. Basically, it is composed of a free GCC-based toolchain for both the PPU and SPUs, the free run-time environment (the libspe2), a proprietary toolchain, the proprietary IBM SystemSim for Cell simulator and some other tools (a mixture of free and non-free ones). So, as you can see, we have some free components and some proprietary ones. You can, in fact, develop for the Cell architecture by using the free components alone. So why on earth do you need the proprietary ones? Why can't you skip them? Why aren't they available in some nice repository that I can use without any external "installer" and avoid such crap? That's something I don't get. (Maybe it's possible with some extra effort, but not what the instructions tell you.)<br><br>OK, back to the installer. So you need to copy the two ISOs in a temporary directory, say <tt>/tmp/iso</tt> and then run the installer by doing something like:<pre># cd /opt/cell<br># ./cellsdk --iso /tmp/dir install</pre>This will first proceed to show you some license agreements. Here is one funny point: you must accept the GPL and LGPL terms. Come on! I am using Fedora, and I am already using lots of GPL'd components for which I did not see the license. Why do I have to do that? And why do I have to reaccept the IBM license terms when I already did that in the downloads page?<br><br>After the license thing, it mounts the images under /tmp/sdk (keep this in mind because we'll get back to it later), probably does some black magic and at last launches <tt>yum groupinstall</tt> with multiple parameters to install all the SDK components. All right, you accept the installation details and it starts installing stuff. This would be OK if it wasn't for the network connection problems I mentioned earlier; I've had to restart this part dozens of times (literally) to be able to get all packages. So, again, question: why couldn't you simply tell me what to put in yum's configuration, define some installation groups for the free components <i>alone</i> and let me use yum to install those without having to trust some foreign and crappy installer script? Why do you insist on using /opt for some components and uninconsistently between architectures?<br><br>And why did I mention /tmp/sdk? Because the yum repositories registered by the installer have this location hardcoded in. Once you unmount the ISO images (that is, when the installation is done), yum will keep complaining about missing files in /tmp/sdk <i>forever</i> &mdash; unless you manually change yum's configuration, that is. What is nicer, though, is that yum <i>always</i> complains about one specific repository because it is only available online, yet it also looks for a corresponding image in /tmp/sdk.<br><br>At last, there are also some random problems (probably caused by all the above inconsistencies). Once, the script finalized successfully but the SDK was left half installed: some components were missing. Another time, the installer hang in the middle (no CPU consuption at all, no system activity) when it seemed it had finished and had to manually kill it. After restarting it, it effectively had not finished as it had to install some more stuff.<br><br>Summarizing... all these problems may not be so important, but they make one feel that the whole SDK is a very clunky thing.<br><br>I wish someone could create native packages for the free components of the SDK and import them into the official Fedora (or, please, please, please, Debian) repositories. After all, these are just a native compiler for the PPU, a cross-compiler for the SPUs, the libspe2 and the SPU's newlib. Note that the GCC backends for both the PPU and SPUs are already part of the FSF trees, so it shouldn't be too difficult to achieve by using official, nicer sources.<br><br>Rant time over.</p><p class=text-muted>November 18, 2007

Due to timing constraints and the complexity of the subject (should I also mention bad planning?), I have been unable to implement most of them even though I wanted to do so at the very beginning. The code I've done is so crappy that I won't be sharing it anytime soon, but if there is interest I might clean it up (I mean, rewrite it from the ground up) and publish it to a wider audience.<br><br>Anyway, to the real point of this post.

Fortunately, installing the <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_9>libspe</span>2 is trivial if you use the appropriate <a href="http://www.bsc.es/plantillaH.php?cat_id=254">binary packages provided by <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_10>BSC</span></a>, but things get interesting if you try to build it from sources. As I need to inspect its code and do some changes in it, I have to be able to rebuild its code, so I had to go with the latter option.<br><br>Let's see how to build and install <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_11>libspe</span>2 from sources on a PS3 running <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_12>YDL</span>5.<br><br>The first step is to download the most up-to-date <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_13>SRPM</span> package for the <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_14>libspe</span>2, which at the time of this writing was <a href=http://www.bsc.es/projects/deepcomputing/linuxoncell/cellsimulator/sdk2.0/libspe2-2.0.1-1.src.rpm>libspe2-2.0.1-1.src.rpm</a>.

The first is the installation of quilt (for which no binary package exists in the <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_19>YDL</span>5 repositories), a required tool in <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_20>libspe</span>2's build process. The second is the updating of bash to a newer version, as the one distributed in <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_21>YDL</span>5 has a quoting bug that prevents quilt from being built properly.<br><br>The easiest way to solve these problems is to look for the corresponding <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_22>SRPM</span> packages for quilt and an updated bash. As <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_23>YDL</span>5 is based on Fedora Core, a safe bet is to fetch the necessary files from the Fedora Core 6 (FC6) repositories; these were: <a href=ftp://ftp.rediris.es/mirror/fedora-extras/6/SRPMS/quilt-0.46-1.fc6.src.rpm>quilt-0.46-1.fc6.src.rpm</a> and <a href=ftp://ftp.rediris.es/mirror/fedora/6/source/SRPMS/bash-3.1-16.1.src.rpm>bash-3.1-16.1.src.rpm</a>. After that, proceed with their installation as shown above for <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_24>libspe</span>2 (using <tt>rpm -i</tt>).<br><br>With all the sources in place, it is time to build and install them in the right order. Luckily the <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_25>FC</span>6 <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_26>SRPMs</span> we need work fine in <span class=blsp-spelling-error id=SPELLING_ERROR_27>YDL</span>5, but this might not be true for other packages.

At first, I wanted to work on a regression testing framework for NetBSD. This is something I really want to see done and I'd work on it if I had enough free time now... Unfortunately, it didn't fit quite well my expectations for the PFC: it was a project not related at all with the current research subjects in my faculty, hence it was not appropriate enough to integrate into one of these work groups.<br><br>So, after inverstigating some of the projects proposed by these research groups, I've finally settled on one that revolves around <i>heterogeneous multiprocessor systems</i> such as the <a href=http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/power/cell/>Cell Broadband Engine</a>. The resulting code will be based on Linux as it is the main (only?) platform for Cell development, but the concepts should still be applicable to other systems. Who knows, maybe I'll end up trying to port NetBSD to a Cell machine &mdash; shouldn't be too hard if <a href=http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-macppc/2006/06/07/0000.html>that G5 support</a> is integrated ;-)<br><br>The preliminary title: <i>Efficient resource management in heterogeneous multiprocessor systems</i>. For more details, check out the <a href=http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/pfc/proposal.pdf>Project proposal</a> (still not concreted, as you can see).</p><p class=text-muted>January 27, 2007
