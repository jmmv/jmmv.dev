As a non-native English speaker, inserting such letters is something I occasionally have to do but somehow the topic didn&amp;rsquo;t cross my mind. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Keyboard shortcuts</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-shortcuts.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-shortcuts.html</guid><description>&lt;p>As I mentioned in &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html">the introduction to these series&lt;/a>, different physical keyboards are a source of frustration. This, however, pales in comparison to trying to use Windows as a former macOS user: the different keyboard shortcuts break muscle memory, and this made me feel completely unproductive and&amp;hellip; furious every time I made a mistake.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Introduction</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html</guid><description>&lt;p>A bit over a week ago, I narrated &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/my-story-with-windows.html">my decades-long love and hate relationship with Windows&lt;/a>. Today, it&amp;rsquo;s time to &lt;em>start&lt;/em> covering my impressions of this platform after spending a year on it as my primary OS. This is noteworthy because I had been a Unix-only person for about 25 years and spent the last 15 on macOS alone. Switching to Windows 10 and 11 has been quite a change and&amp;hellip; for the most part, a positive one. I like what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Windows 10 on a Mac Pro 2013</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/windows-10-mac-pro-2013.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 05:20:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/windows-10-mac-pro-2013.html</guid><description>The Mac Pro 2013 is the most powerful machine I have at home. I love the hardware looks, its small form factor and its quietness, plus it is still fast enough for my needs. As I realized I hadn&amp;rsquo;t used macOS for months and I needed to recover the SSD space that this system was using, I&amp;rsquo;ve done the unthinkable: I have installed Windows 10 as the only OS on this machine. Here is all you need to know to make Windows 10 work well on this hardware, no matter if you choose to use Boot Camp or do a full clean install as I did.</description></item><item><title>Configuring SSH access into WSL 1 and WSL 2</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/wsl-ssh-access.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/wsl-ssh-access.html</guid><description>One of the reasons I like macOS is that it is a Unix system. Thanks to this, it&amp;rsquo;s trivial to set up an SSH server to remotely access and administer the machine, which in turn has allowed me to have a nice and powerful desktop computer which I can also leverage when I&amp;rsquo;m on the go.
Moving to Windows full time, as I briefly touched upon in My story with Windows, required that I could do the same on this platform.</description></item><item><title>My story with Windows</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/my-story-with-windows.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 05:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/my-story-with-windows.html</guid><description>&lt;p>It has been a year since I went all-in on Windows as my daily driver. I had been off this platform for more than 25 years, spending the first 10 of those on Linux and the BSDs, and the latter 15 on macOS alone. This switch is A Big Deal™️&amp;mdash;to me at least.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to tell you how Windows 10 and 11 feel these days to someone who hadn&amp;rsquo;t touched this OS for a long time. But, before I can do that, let me tell you my story with Windows. This might be boring so I&amp;rsquo;ve sprinkled some images to evoke retro feelings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>macOS keyboard shortcuts for Windows</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/07/macos-ahk.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/07/macos-ahk.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Are you a macOS user occasionally dealing with Windows systems or trying to switch platforms? Are you a Windows user that believes that the Windows-native keyboard shortcuts are objectively bad? Are you annoyed by something as simple as copy/pasting text not working consistently across apps?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If so, this post will equip you with an &lt;a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotkey&lt;/a> configuration file that brings macOS keyboard shortcuts to Windows.

You can finally run your Linux tooling on Windows as a first class citizen, which means you no longer have to learn PowerShell or, god forbid, suffer through the ancient CMD.EXE console.
Unfortunately, not everything is as rosy as it sounds.</description></item><item><title>Argument processing in Unix and Windows</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/cmdline-args-unix-vs-windows.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2020 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/cmdline-args-unix-vs-windows.html</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s continue our dive into the very interesting topic of how Unix (or Linux or what have you) and Windows differ regarding argument processing. And by that I mean: how a program (the caller) communicates the set of arguments to pass to another program (the callee) at execution time, how the callee receives such arguments, and what are the consequences of each design.</description></item><item><title>Configuring Windows for key-based SSH access</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/windows-ssh-access.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 05:45:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/windows-ssh-access.html</guid><description>Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 both ship with OpenSSH (server and client). Installing these components is a breeze, but the official documentation to set everything up is either wrong or incomplete. I wanted to set up key-based authentication and this took quite a bit of poking until I figured out all the right knobs. Here are the lab notes from my adventure.</description></item><item><title>Flags parsing in PowerShell (vs. Unix)</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/powershell-cmdlet-params.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 06:45:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/powershell-cmdlet-params.html</guid><description>The way PowerShell handles flags in scripts (aka cmdlets) differs completely from what Unix shells do. These differences allow PowerShell to gain insight on how scripts have to be executed, which in turn can deliver a better interactive user experience. Read on for a comparison while wearing Unix-tinted glasses.</description></item><item><title>Windows 3.1 startup speed</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2009/01/windows-31-startup-speed.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2009 09:36:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2009/01/windows-31-startup-speed.html</guid><description>Out of boredom, I installed MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 on my machine a few days ago &amp;mdash; yeah, I was inspired by the Hot Dog Stand comments in this post. Check it out here. Don't be scared, it was just a virtual machine!
Anyway, this was fun because it reminded me of something. Back in 1994, my father bought a Pentium 60Mhz. After ordering it, we imagined how fast it could be compared to our older machine, a 386DX 40Mhz.</description></item></channel></rss>
