      <title>Windows Subsystem for Linux: The lost potential</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/wsl-lost-potential.html</link>

      <description>If you have followed Windows 10 at all during the last few years, you know that the Windows Subsystem for Linux, or WSL for short, is the hot topic among developers. You can finally run your Linux tooling on Windows as a first class citizen, which means you no longer have to learn PowerShell or, god forbid, suffer through the ancient CMD.EXE console.
Unfortunately, not everything is as rosy as it sounds.</description>

      <title>Argument processing in Unix and Windows</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s continue our dive into the very interesting topic of how Unix (or Linux or what have you) and Windows differ regarding argument processing. And by that I mean: how a program (the caller) communicates the set of arguments to pass to another program (the callee) at execution time, how the callee receives such arguments, and what are the consequences of each design.
NOTE: Pay attention to this post because this is interview-level material for a systems internals session!</description>

      <title>Configuring Windows for key-based SSH access</title>

      <description>I despise remote desktop access. The way it breaks keybindings is something that messes with my muscle memory pretty badly. That&amp;rsquo;s why I ended up working on Bazel&amp;rsquo;s macOS port at Google: I wanted to expand the ability to develop on Macs natively instead of relying on remote Linux workstations. But I now have to use remote Windows VMs for Azure development because that&amp;rsquo;s the way it is, so I&amp;rsquo;ll have to cope.</description>

      <description>One of my personal goals with my new position at Microsoft is to learn more about Windows and its ecosystem. As you know, I&amp;rsquo;m a systems person and I&amp;rsquo;ve been in the Unix and macOS realm for the last&amp;hellip; 22 years or so. During this time, I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly touched Windows here and there but, for the most part, a lot of it remains a mystery to me.
Yesterday already, I uncovered a couple of interesting things worth discussing.</description>

      <title>Windows 3.1 startup speed</title>

      <description>Out of boredom, I installed MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 on my machine a few days ago &amp;mdash; yeah, I was inspired by the Hot Dog Stand comments in this post. Check it out here. Don&#39;t be scared, it was just a virtual machine!
Anyway, this was fun because it reminded me of something. Back in 1994, my father bought a Pentium 60Mhz. After ordering it, we imagined how fast it could be compared to our older machine, a 386DX 40Mhz.</description>
