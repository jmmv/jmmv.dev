I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to answer this question for years and I can do so now, which means I want to present you my findings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My desire to know about NT&amp;rsquo;s internals started in 2006 when I applied to the Google Summer of Code program to develop Boost.Process. I needed such a library for ATF, but I also saw the project as a chance to learn something about the Win32 API. This journey then continued in 2020 with me &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/bye-google-hi-microsoft.html">choosing to join Microsoft&lt;/a> after a long stint at Google and me buying the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Internals-Part-architecture-management/dp/0735684189?crid=2F7UR8S48RP6O&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.p9cBb_-Q8GjuK0z0kDLKG6xoExPM_2QWt_jn0PlqVBSWYNyqRp2Cd7MHXFeQ4EiRACaX_Y_9xzECC0YpECzSl5kCBD3u1KUPduAgmnO732G9aqw1aLdQszw8LIXBOE1cYvOf3KYQmQ5vdFV6i4eFOttVvIa2XerkHVGiPd1OzTk32tEOchCbnUqpzW3QqCG7AjEmmKHFGuo5T2_UQDUERaSVRa26oAZHYuePCzDrwbY.bcHnZQWFYjmL64ZRnMieVsUH5JVx-T-WY88kj8V-uno&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=windows+internals&amp;amp;qid=1725808358&amp;amp;sprefix=windows+internals%2Caps%2C155&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=blogsystem5-20&amp;amp;linkId=08d00ee830fe99b6e648add99e1b64c5&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Windows Internals&lt;/a> 5th edition book in 2021 (which I never fully read due to its incredible detail and length). None of these made me learn what I wanted though: the ways in which NT fundamentally differs from Unix, if at all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A CLI text editor? In my Windows?</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/a-cli-text-editor-in-my-windows.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Dec 2023 14:45:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/a-cli-text-editor-in-my-windows.html</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>It&amp;rsquo;s more likely than you think!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a surprising twist of events, Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/plante_msft/status/1732857615997132834">exploring the addition of a command-line (CLI) text editor to Windows&lt;/a>. If you ask me, &lt;em>not&lt;/em> having a CLI text editor on Windows is mind-boggling: you can access a Windows machine via SSH these days, so not having an editor that works in the console is a big handicap for remote system administration. So, should Windows bundle a CLI text editor? Of course it should.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Windows NT: Peeking into the cradle</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/windows-nt-peeking-into-the-cradle.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2023 09:40:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/11/windows-nt-peeking-into-the-cradle.html</guid><description>&lt;p>It's strange... but I've been able to finish reading a book cover-to-cover that's not a book for my kids. It's hard for me to get hooked into books and find the time to read them. I think the one I finished before this might have been 10 PRINT, and that was over a year ago. This time, though, I completed the book on the story behind the creation of Windows NT: namely, "Showstopper!" in its short form, written by G. Pascal Zachary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reading the story of how Windows NT came to be was entertaining, as it is a story of the system itself and the dynamics between Dave Cutler, the original designer and lead for NT, and the other people involved in the project. I was shy of being 10 years old when Windows NT launched and I didn't comprehend what was going on in the operating systems world and why this release was such a big deal. Reading the book made me learn various new things about the development process, the role of Microsoft in that era, and allowed me to settle some questions I've had over the years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article is a mixture of a book review and a collection of thoughts and reflections that the book evoked. Let's begin because we have a lot of ground to cover.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Finale</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-finale.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2022 07:20:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-finale.html</guid><description>&lt;p>We have reached the end of this daily 2-week long series so it&amp;rsquo;s time to close with some parting thoughts.

That, however, does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> mean that it is &lt;em>opaque&lt;/em>. In fact, it feels quite the opposite in many areas, which might be a surprise to you&amp;mdash;especially if you develop on/for open-source operating systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Networked file systems</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-networked-fs.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-networked-fs.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I briefly mentioned in the &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html">intro to this series&lt;/a> that, as part of the transition to Windows, I recently built my most powerful home server ever. The server in question is a machine from 2011 so it&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;powerful&amp;rdquo;, but it&amp;rsquo;s the best I have ever had as a home server! And it is running FreeBSD 13.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On the one hand, the batch language is &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050909-24/?p=34263">full of hacks&lt;/a> that have cropped up over the years. These hacks exist to offer new features while maintaining strict backwards compatibility, a heroic effort with nasty consequences. On the other hand, the interactive editing features of &lt;code>cmd.exe&lt;/code> are rudimentary&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, PowerShell exists as a first-party, built-into-Windows alternative to &lt;code>cmd.exe&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Development experience</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-devel.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-devel.html</guid><description>&lt;p>We are finally entering the final part of this one-year retrospective by shifting gears into developer-oriented topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hadn&amp;rsquo;t touched Windows to write code since 2006 and the development experience has massively changed for the better during the last 6 years. So let&amp;rsquo;s start this part by talking about the crown jewel of development on modern Windows: the WSL + Windows Terminal + VSCode trifecta.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Miscellaneous tools</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-tools.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-tools.html</guid><description>&lt;p>The previous episode in this series was about PowerToys: a nice collection of first-party tools to extend the functionality of Windows for power users.

PowerToys &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerToys#PowerToys_for_Windows_95">was a collection&lt;/a> of first-party miscellaneous utilities targeted at power users and it died off sometime around 2010. In a surprising (to me) move on May 2019, Microsoft relaunched this brand as an &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys">open-source project&lt;/a> targeting modern versions of Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time of this writing, PowerToys provides 12 different disparate tools. Which ones you find interesting will depend on your needs. As for me, here are my favorite picks after a year of experimentation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Window switching</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-alt-tab.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-alt-tab.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Windows is about managing windows so it should excel at window switching. Uh huh? Let&amp;rsquo;s investigate how that works in this episode and how Windows&amp;rsquo; approach feels to a long-time macOS user.

Let&amp;rsquo;s shift this one-year reflection to the user interface and slowly towards more positive topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s make one thing clear: GUIs are like colors. There are plenty to choose from, everyone has their preferences, and that&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em>fine&lt;/em>. Windows&amp;rsquo; GUI is what it is and doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave a lot of room for customization. If you are a macOS user, you have learnt to put up with a similar approach, but if you are a Linux user, you will despair at the lack of options.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Input methods</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-input.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 09:45:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-input.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post on this series was almost a rant on how keyboard shortcuts &lt;del>don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/del> work on Windows. &lt;code>@blude&lt;/code> on Twitter was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blude/status/1501214824784666628?s=20&amp;amp;t=WvhNLIzGiWVy8rmznG54xA">curious to know about inserting &amp;ldquo;special characters&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, which is really an euphemism for non-English letters. As a non-native English speaker, inserting such letters is something I occasionally have to do but somehow the topic didn&amp;rsquo;t cross my mind.
