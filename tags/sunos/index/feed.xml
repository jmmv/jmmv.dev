      <description>I have always thought that unlink(2) was meant to remove files only but, yesterday, SunOS (SXDE 200709) proved my wrong. I was sanity-checking the source tree for the imminent ATF 0.4 release under this platform, which is always scary, and the tests for the atf::fs::remove function were failing &amp;mdash; only when run as root.
The failure happened in the cleanup phase of the test case, in which ATF attempts to recursively remove the temporary work directory.</description>
