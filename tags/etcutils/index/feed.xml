It provides a (reduced) tool-set to programmatically manage files in &lt;tt>/etc&lt;/tt> and is specially designed to allow pkgsrc to update &lt;tt>/etc/shells&lt;/tt> and &lt;tt>/etc/services&lt;/tt> in a more consistent way.&lt;br />&lt;br />I'm happy to say that the 0.1 release is now ready! Go to the &lt;a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/etcutils/">etcutils web page&lt;/a> for details. (I know that if you are a Linux user, you probably don't care about this because your distribution most likely already provides something similar... albeit more complex.)&lt;br />&lt;br />I'll now proceed to import this new package into pkgsrc as &lt;tt>sysutils/etcutils&lt;/tt>. Later on (most likely not today), the following should happen: rework pkginstall to use the new shells(8) utility to update &lt;tt>/etc/shells&lt;/tt>, add a new feature to pkgsrc to abstract the updates to &lt;tt>/etc/services&lt;/tt>, and swipe through pkgsrc to make all packages touching this file use the new frameworky option. (Hey FAM, that includes you!)</description></item></channel></rss>
