As I worked on the draft for that topic, I realized that there is a ton of ground to cover to set the stage so I took most of the content on memory management out and wrote this separate post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article is a deep dive on how DOS had to pull out tricks to maximize the use of the very limited 1 MB address space of the 8086. Those tricks could exist because of the features later introduced by the 80286 and the 80386, but these were just clutches to paper over the fact that DOS could not leverage the real improvements provided by protected mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This detour is long but I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy it as much as I enjoyed researching the topic. I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the changes in the x86 architecture over time, starting with the 8086 and ending in the 80386, and how DOS kept up along the way. I&amp;rsquo;ll conclude with a peek into DOS&amp;rsquo; own &lt;tt>MEM&lt;/tt> and MemMaker utilities. I must omit details to keep the text manageable in size though, so please excuse the lack of detail in some areas; just follow the links to external documentation to learn more.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-01-17-8086-dos.jpg" length="220943" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
