      <description>The Shell Toolkit, or shtk for short, is a little project I introduced back in August of 2008 to support other tools such as sysbuild and sysupgrade. Since that time, the project has seen little activity because it did not have much to offer and because shtk&#39;s public interface was not documented (hence making it impossible for developers to get started with shtk).
Well, both are changing today with the brand-new release of shtk 1.</description>

      <description>Over a year ago, I developed two command line utilities for NetBSD (sysbuild and sysupgrade) and a supporting library for the two tools (shtk). These were all introduced in their corresponding blog posts &amp;mdash;Introducing sysbuild for NetBSD, Introducing sysupgrade for NetBSD and Introducing shtk&amp;mdash; and since then I have heard good comments about them.
About a couple of weeks ago, I started working on the much-needed rewrite of pkg_comp and a supporting standalone tool.</description>
