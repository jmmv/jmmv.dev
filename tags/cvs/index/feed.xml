      <description>Once again, CVS shows its weaknesses. Last night I committed a fix to pkgsrc and soon after I noticed I had a prior e-mail by Alistair, a member of PMC and the one responsible for the preparation of pkgsrc releases, asking developers to stop committing to the tree because he was going to tag it for pkgsrc-2007Q4. It turns out that my fix did not get into the branch because the directory it went in (devel/monotone) had already been tagged.</description>

      <description>First of all, happy new year to everybody!
I&#39;ve recently got a MacBook Pro and, while this little machine is great overall, the 5400 RPM hard disk is a noticeable performance bottleneck. Many people I&#39;ve talked to say that the difference from 5400 to 7200 RPM should not be noticeable because:These 2.5-inch drives use perpendicular recording, hence storing data with a higher bit density. This means that, theorically, they can read/write data more quickly achieving speeds similar to 7200 RPM drives.</description>
