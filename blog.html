I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy at work, traveling during school breaks, hacking on EndBASIC when time permitted, and&mldr; as of two weeks ago&mldr; tinkering with 3D printing as a complete beginner. So, today, I&rsquo;d like to walk you through the latter because it has been a really fun and rewarding journey, albeit frustrating at times.</p><p>You&rsquo;d think that to use a 3D printer, you&rsquo;d design a 3D model and then&mldr; just&mldr; send it to the printer? That&rsquo;s almost true, but it ignores the realities of producing a physical object from an &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; model: when designing such a model, you need to take into account the limitations of 3D printing and you need to translate your model into something the 3D printer can understand via a process called <em>slicing</em>.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a brief peek at all of these steps. I&rsquo;ll assume you are a complete beginner like I am. The pictures I&rsquo;ll show are all for a &ldquo;first project&rdquo; I did to remake the bars of a bird cage I have, as the birds had fully destroyed the previous ones.</p></p><p class=text-muted>May 28, 2025

And if you did not witness that (lucky you) here is how it went: every piece of hardware in your PC&mdash;say a sound card or a network card&mdash;had physical switches or jumpers in it. These switches configured the card&rsquo;s I/O address space, interrupts, and DMA ports, and you had to be careful to select values that did not overlap with other cards.</p><p>But that wasn&rsquo;t all. Once you had configured the physical switches, you had to tell the operating system and/or software <em>which</em> specific cards you had and how you had configured them. Remember <code>SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H5</code>? This DOS environment variable told programs which specific Sound Blaster you had installed and which I/O settings you had selected via its jumpers.</p><p>Not really fun. It was common to have hardware conflicts that yielded random lock-ups, and thus <a href=https://wiki.osdev.org/ISA>ISA &ldquo;Plug and Play&rdquo;</a>, or PnP for short, was born in the early 1990s&mdash;a protocol for the legacy ISA bus to enumerate its devices and to configure their settings via software. Fast-forward to today&rsquo;s scene where we just attach devices to external USB connectors and things &ldquo;magically work&rdquo;.</p><p>But how? How does the kernel know which physical devices exist and how does it know which of the many device drivers it contains can handle each device? Enter the world of hardware discovery.</p></p><p class=text-muted>February 28, 2025

It&rsquo;s better to say <em>file descriptors</em> provide access to almost every system that the kernel provides, but not that they can all be manipulated with the same quartet of system calls, nor that they all behave as byte streams.</p><p>Because you see: network connections are manipulated via file descriptors indeed, but you don&rsquo;t <code>open</code> them: you <code>bind</code>, <code>listen</code>/<code>accept</code> and/or <code>connect</code> to them. And then you don&rsquo;t <code>read</code> from and <code>write</code> to network connections: you somehow <code>send</code> to and <code>recv</code> from them. Device drivers are similar: yes, hardware devices are represented as &ldquo;virtual files&rdquo; in the <code>/dev</code> hierarchy and many support <code>read</code> and <code>write</code>&mldr; but these two system calls are not sufficient to access the breath of functionality that the hardware drivers provide. No, you need <code>ioctl</code>.</p><p><code>ioctl</code> is the poster child of the system call that breaks Unix&rsquo;s &ldquo;everything is a file&rdquo; paradigm. <code>ioctl</code> is the API that allows out-of-band communication with the kernel side of an open file descriptor. To see cool examples, <a href=/2025/01/netbsd-graphics-wo-x11.html>refer back to my previous article</a> where I demonstrated how to drive graphics from the console without X11: in that post, we had to <code>open</code> the console device, but then we had to use <code>ioctl</code> to obtain the properties of the framebuffer, and then we had to <code>mmap</code> the device&rsquo;s content for direct access: no <code>read</code>s nor <code>write</code>s involved.</p><p>All the code I showed you in that earlier post was written in C to keep the graphics article to-the-point, but the code I&rsquo;m really working on is part of EndBASIC, and thus it is all Rust. And the thing is, <code>ioctl</code>s are not easy to issue from Rust. In fact, after 7 years of Rust-ing, it&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve had to reach for <code>unsafe</code> code blocks, and there was no good documentation on how to deal with <code>ioctl</code>. So this posts aims to fix that by presenting what ways there are to call <code>ioctl</code>s from Rust&mldr; and, of course, diving a bit deeper into what <code>ioctl</code>s actually <em>are</em>.</p></p><p class=text-muted>February 13, 2025

What you may not know is that, now, it can also achieve this feat on the NetBSD console without using X11 at all.

And the thing is: Make allows doing this sort of stitching with relative ease. Sure, Make is not the best option because the overall build performance is &ldquo;meh&rdquo; and because incremental builds are almost-impossible to get right&mldr; but adopting Bazel for this project would be an almost-infinite time sink.</p><p>Anyway. When using Make in this manner, you often end up with what&rsquo;s essentially a &ldquo;command dispatcher&rdquo; and, over time, the number of commands grows and it&rsquo;s hard to make sense of which one to use for what. Sure, you can write a <code>README.md</code> with instructions, but I guarantee you that the text will get out of sync faster than you can read this article. There is a better way, though.</p></p><p class=text-muted>January 10, 2025

As I explored my options, I came to the conclusion that NetBSD, the often-forgotten BSD variant, was the best viable choice for my project.</p><p>One reason for this choice is NetBSD&rsquo;s build system. Once you look and get past the fact that it feels frozen in time since 2002, you realize it is still one of the most advanced build systems you can find for an OS. And it shows: the NetBSD build system allows you to build the full OS from scratch, on pretty much any host POSIX platform, while targeting any hardware architecture supported by NetBSD. All without root privileges.</p><p>Another reason for this choice is that NetBSD was my daily workhorse for many years and I&rsquo;m quite familiar with its internals, which is useful knowledge to quickly achieve the goals I have in mind. In fact, I was a NetBSD Developer with capital D: I had commit access to the project from about 2002 through 2012 or so, and I have just revived my account in service of this project. <code>jmmv@</code> is back!</p><p>So, strap onto your seats and let&rsquo;s see how today&rsquo;s NetBSD build system looks like and what makes it special. I&rsquo;ll add my own critique at the end, because it ain&rsquo;t perfect, but overall it continues to deliver on its design goals set in the late 1990s.</p></p><p class=text-muted>December 28, 2024

I first hosted the server on a PowerMac G5 and then upgraded it to an overkill 72-core ThinkStation that I snapped second-hand for a great price.</p><p>But as stable and low maintenance as FreeBSD is, running day-to-day services myself is not my idea of &ldquo;fun&rdquo;. This drove me to replace this machine&rsquo;s routing functionality with a dedicated pfSense box a year ago and, for similar reasons, I have been curious about dedicated NAS solutions.</p><p>I was pretty close to buying a second-hand NAS from the work classifieds channel when a Synology marketing person (hi Kyle!) contacted me to offer a partnership: they&rsquo;d ship me <a href=https://sy.to/hekgh>one of their devices</a> for free in exchange for me publishing a few articles about it. Given my interest to drive-test one of these appliances without committing to buying one (they ain&rsquo;t cheap and I wasn&rsquo;t convinced I wanted to get rid of my FreeBSD-based solution), I was game.</p><p>And you guessed right: this article is one of those I promised to write but, before you stop reading, the answer is no. This post is <em>not</em> sponsored by Synology and has not been reviewed nor approved by them. The content here, including any opinions, are purely my own. And what I want do do here is compare how the Synology appliance stacks against my home-built FreeBSD server.</p></p><p class=text-muted>December 13, 2024

I had done this about a year ago with FreeBSD as the host, and going through this process once again reminded me of how painful it is to secure an NFS connection.</p><p>You see, Samba is much easier to set up, but because NFS is the native file sharing protocol of Unix systems, I felt compelled to use it instead. However, if you opt for NFSv3 (the &ldquo;easy default&rdquo;), you are left with a system that has zero security: traffic travels unencrypted and unsigned, and the server trusts the client when the client asserts who is who. Madness for today&rsquo;s standards. Yet, when you look around, people say &ldquo;oh, but NFSv3 is fine if you trust the network!&rdquo; But seriously, who trusts the network in this day and age?</p><p>You have to turn to NFSv4 <em>and</em> combine it with Kerberos for a secure file sharing option. And let me tell you: the experience of setting these up and getting things to work is horrible, and the documentation out there is terrible. Most documents are operating-system specific so they only tell you what works when a specific server and a specific client talk to each other. Other documents just <em>assume</em>, and thus omit, various important details of the configuration.</p><p>So. This article is my recollection of &ldquo;lab notes&rdquo; on how to set this whole thing up along with the necessary background to understand NFSv4 and Kerberos. My specific setup involes the Synology DS923+ as the NFSv4 server; Fedora, Debian, and FreeBSD clients; and the supporting KDC on a pfSense (or FreeBSD) box.</p></p><p class=text-muted>November 3, 2024
