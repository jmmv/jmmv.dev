I&rsquo;ve been grumpy about the &ldquo;push from above to use AI or else&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve been grumpy about the eye-rolling hype I see on LinkedIn. I&rsquo;ve been grumpy about being on the receiving end of vibe-coded PRs that over-engineer solutions to simple problems. I&rsquo;ve been grumpy about the thought that we are about to see an amount of bloat like we have never imagined before.</p><p>But, at the same time, I&rsquo;ve been using LLMs to review my articles, to perform deep research, to generate cover pictures, and before last week, I had even dipped my toes into AI-based coding agents to help me with boring, repetitive tasks. And you know what? I see their promise of increased productivity, yet the amounts of slop I&rsquo;ve witnessed make me skeptical and I have had little experience with coding agents myself to judge their promised usefulness.</p><p>So&mldr; surprise! Last weekend I decided to start a Claude Code subscription and, after spending a week on it, I am uncomfortably excited to use it more. How has this happened? Let&rsquo;s take a look at how I ended here, the kinds of mini-projects I worked on throughout this past week, and the (semi-expected) downsides I encountered.</p></p><p class=text-muted>February 9, 2026

In it, I described how SSH agent forwarding works&mdash;a feature that lets a remote machine use the credentials stored in your local ssh-agent instance&mdash;and how using a console multiplexer like tmux or screen often breaks it.</p><p>In that article, I presented the <a href=https://github.com/jmmv/ssh-agent-switcher/>ssh-agent-switcher</a>: a program I put together in a few hours to fix this problem. In short, ssh-agent-switcher exposes an agent socket at a stable location (<code>/tmp/ssh-agent.${USER?}</code> by default) and proxies all incoming credential requests to the transient socket that the sshd server creates on a connection basis.</p><p>In this article, I want to formalize this project by presenting its first actual release, 1.0.0, and explain what has changed to warrant this release number. I put effort into creating this formal release because ssh-agent-switcher has organically gained more interest than I imagined as it is solving a real problem that various people have.</p></p><p class=text-muted>December 26, 2025

And they must go away because they are redundant: they just repeat the dependency information that&rsquo;s already encoded in the in-code import/use statements.</p><p>Hearing this from newcomers to Bazel isn&rsquo;t surprising: after all, most newcomers are used to build tools that provide zero facilities to express dependencies across the sources of your own project. Hearing it from old-timers, however, is disappointing because it misses the point of what BUILD files can truly offer.</p></p><p class=text-muted>September 26, 2025

The goal here is to introduce the <strong>Action Cache (AC)</strong>, the <strong>Content Addressable Storage (CAS)</strong>, how they play together, and then have some fun in describing the many ways in which it&rsquo;s possible to poison such a cache in an accidental or malicious manner.</p></p><p class=text-muted>September 5, 2025

This system, however, relies on a fundamental principle: build actions must be deterministic.

We will start with action non-determinism, then cover remote caching and execution, and finally, explore the security implications of these features.</p><p>This first article explains what non-determinism is, how it manifests, and how you can diagnose and prevent it in your own builds.
