The free plan I was using was going to be decommissioned and the alternatives I tried didn&rsquo;t seem to support custom handlers written in Rust. I still had three years to deal with this, but hitting a showstopper error pushed me to take action.</p><p>All of my web services are now hosted by the FreeBSD server in my garage with just a few tweaks to their codebase. This is their migration story.</p></p><p class=text-muted>December 7, 2025

An extra hackathon day, organized by Aspect Build, followed. Unfortunately, a canceled flight meant I missed the tutorials, but I attended the rest of the events.

And they must go away because they are redundant: they just repeat the dependency information that&rsquo;s already encoded in the in-code import/use statements.</p><p>Hearing this from newcomers to Bazel isn&rsquo;t surprising: after all, most newcomers are used to build tools that provide zero facilities to express dependencies across the sources of your own project. Hearing it from old-timers, however, is disappointing because it misses the point of what BUILD files can truly offer.</p></p><p class=text-muted>September 26, 2025

The goal here is to introduce the <strong>Action Cache (AC)</strong>, the <strong>Content Addressable Storage (CAS)</strong>, how they play together, and then have some fun in describing the many ways in which it&rsquo;s possible to poison such a cache in an accidental or malicious manner.</p></p><p class=text-muted>September 5, 2025

This system, however, relies on a fundamental principle: build actions must be deterministic. For the most part, Bazel helps ensure that they are, but in the odd cases when they aren&rsquo;t, builds can fail in subtle and frustrating ways, eroding trust in the build system.</p><p>This article is the first in a series on Bazel&rsquo;s execution model. Having explained these concepts many times, I want to provide a detailed reference before explaining a cool solution to a problem I recently developed at work. We will start with action non-determinism, then cover remote caching and execution, and finally, explore the security implications of these features.</p><p>This first article explains what non-determinism is, how it manifests, and how you can diagnose and prevent it in your own builds.

Born out of my work supporting iOS development, it was my attempt to solve a persistent pain point that frustrated both internal teams and external users alike: Bazel&rsquo;s <a href=https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8230>poor sandboxing performance on macOS</a>.</p><p>sandboxfs was a user-space file system designed to efficiently create virtual file hierarchies backed by real files&mdash;a faster alternative to the &ldquo;symlink forests&rdquo; that Bazel uses to prepare per-action sandboxes. The idea was simple: if we could lower sandbox creation overhead, we could make Bazel&rsquo;s sandboxing actually usable on macOS.</p><p>Unfortunately, things didn&rsquo;t play out as I dreamed. Today, sandboxfs is effectively abandoned, and macOS sandboxing performance remains an unsolved problem. In this post, I&rsquo;ll walk you through why I built sandboxfs, what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and why&mdash;despite its failure&mdash;I still think the core idea holds promise.</p></p><p class=text-muted>June 11, 2025

I&rsquo;ve been pretty busy at work, traveling during school breaks, hacking on EndBASIC when time permitted, and&mldr; as of two weeks ago&mldr; tinkering with 3D printing as a complete beginner. So, today, I&rsquo;d like to walk you through the latter because it has been a really fun and rewarding journey, albeit frustrating at times.</p><p>You&rsquo;d think that to use a 3D printer, you&rsquo;d design a 3D model and then&mldr; just&mldr; send it to the printer? That&rsquo;s almost true, but it ignores the realities of producing a physical object from an &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; model: when designing such a model, you need to take into account the limitations of 3D printing and you need to translate your model into something the 3D printer can understand via a process called <em>slicing</em>.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a brief peek at all of these steps. I&rsquo;ll assume you are a complete beginner like I am. The pictures I&rsquo;ll show are all for a &ldquo;first project&rdquo; I did to remake the bars of a bird cage I have, as the birds had fully destroyed the previous ones.</p></p><p class=text-muted>May 28, 2025
