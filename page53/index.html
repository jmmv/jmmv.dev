        I've been told today about the Piled Higher and Deeper website, also known as phdcomics (easier to remember).  And so far I'm hooked.  I love this comic strip!  May it be because I'm already involved in the research area due to my PFC and I know what they are talking about?  Possibly.  And it also illustrates what I can "expect" if I finally enroll in a Ph.D. course.

        I have just merged my net.venge.monotone.help-rewrite branch into the mainline Monotone's source code.  I already explained its purpose in a past post, so please refer to it to see what has changed.There is still some work to do on the "help rewrite" area, but I won't have the time to do it in the near future.  Hence I added some items to the ROADMAP file explaining what needs to be done, hoping that someone else can pick them up and do the work.  They are not difficult but they can introduce you to Monotone's development if you are interested! ;-)

        I've been using Git (or better said Cogito) recently as part of my PFC and, although I don't like the way Git was started, I must confess I like it a lot.  In some ways it is very similar to Monotone (the version control system I prefer now) but it has its own features that make it very interesting.  One of these is the difference between local and remote branches, something I'll talk about in a future post.For now I would just like to point you to a talk about Git by Linus given at Google.  He focuses more on general concepts of distributed version systems than on Git itself, so most of the ideas given there apply to many other systems as well.  If you still don't see the advantages of distributed VCSs over centralized ones, you must watch this.  Really.  Oh, and it is quite "funny" too ;-)

        pkgsrcCon 2007 is over.  The conference started around 1:00pm on the 27th and has lasted until today^Wyesterday (the 29th) at around 7:00pm.  There have been 10 different talks as planned, although we weren't able to follow the proposed schedule.  Most of the presentations were delayed and some were shifted because the speakers could not arrive on time.  Not a big deal though.We have been, more or less, around 20-25 people.  There were 30 registered, but a couple had to withdraw and some others did not come (for unknown reasons to us).  Maybe the conferences were too technical or the schedule did not meet their expectations.The thing is I originally intended to write a short report after each day, but I have had literally no life outside pkgsrcCon since Thursday night.   Taking care of the organization has been time consuming (and I have done almost nothing!), not to mention that recording all the presentations was exhausting; more on this below.Anyway, it has been an excellent experience.  Meeting other pkgsrc developers in person has been very nice, plus they are all also very nice people too.  Of course, their presentations were also interesting, and they showed extremely interesting ideas from their creators.  I'm specially looking forward to seeing the preliminary results of one of the detailed projects (won't tell you which ;-).So, what did we do?  We started with a pre-pkgsrcCon dinner on Thursday night, which was the first encounter among all developers.  The talks started the day afterwards in the afternoon, and when they were over we had some beers and dinner together.  Saturday was more of the same, even though it had more talks.  We then had dinner on a nicer restaurant; great, great time.  The last talks happened on Sunday, after which we had some more beers and the last dinner all together.I now have to compress all the video recordings and we have yet to decide if we will make them public and how.  Stay tuned!  (And don't hesitate to join for pkgsrcCon 2008; I'm sure you will enjoy it, at the very least as much as I did!)

        A couple of weeks ago, I updated Monotone to 0.34 and noticed a small style problem in the help output: the line wrapping was not working properly, so some words got cut on the terminal's boundary.  After resolving this minor issue, I realized that I didn't know what most of the commands shown in the main help screen did.  Virtually all other command-line utilities that have integrated help show some form of an abstract description for each command which allows the novice to quickly see what they are about.  So why wouldn't Monotone?I started extending the internal commands interface to accept a little abstract for each command and command group, to be later shown in the help output.  This was rather easy, and I posted some preliminary changes in to the mailing list.  But you know what happens when proposing trivial changes...People complained that the new output was too long to be useful, which I agreed on and fixed by only showing commands in a given group at a time.  But... there was also an interesting request: allow the documentation of subcommands (e.g. list keys) in a consistent way with how primary commands (e.g. checkout) are defined.  There is even a bug (#18281) about this issue.And... that has kept me busy for way longer than I expected.  I've ended up rewriting the way commands are defined internally by constructing a tree of commands instead of a plain list.  This allows the generic command lookup algorithm to locate commands at any level in the tree, thus being able to standarize the way to define help and options on them.The work is almost done and can be seen in the net.venge.monotone.help-rewrite branch.I've also been messing with Cogito recently and found some of its user interface features to be very convenient.  These include automatic paging of long output and colored diffs straight on the console.  Something to borrow from them if I ever have the time for it, I guess ;-)

        Yes, Google Summer of Code (SoC) 2007 is back and I'm in once again!  This means I'll be able to spend another summer working on free software and deliver some useful contributions by the end of it.This time I sent just one proposal, choosing NetBSD as the mentoring organization.  The project is entitled Automated testing framework and is mentored by Martin Husemann.  This framework is something I've had in mind for a long time already; in fact, I also applied for this in SoC 2006 and attempted to develop this project as my undergraduate thesis.For more details on what the project is about, check out these notes.At last, take a look at the full list of accepted projects for NetBSD.  It is rather short unfortunately, but they all look very promising.  It is a pity ext3 support is not in them, but getting ZFS instead will be good too.Edit (April 19th): Fixed a link.

        Reviewing photos from my trip to Punta Cana, I found this one taken at Punta Cana's airport:Looks like they had some problems with locales!  The text should have read España (or Spain).On a related note, it was also curious to see all other monitors mention the flight's destination city whereas ours showed the whole country.  According to the other screens, it should have really said Madrid.
