      <p>
        The core component of the new configuration library in Kyua is the utils::config::tree class: a type-safe, dynamic tree data type.  This class provides a mapping of string keys to arbitrary types: all the nodes of the tree have a textual name, and they can either be inner nodes (no value attached to them), or leaf nodes (an arbitrary type attached as a value to them). The keys represent traversals through such tree, and do this by separating the node names with dots (things of the form root.inner1.innerN.leaf).The tree class is the in-memory representation of a configuration file, and is the data structure passed around methods and algorithms to tune their behavior. It replaces the previous config static structure.The following highlights describe the tree class:Keys are (and thus the tree layout is) pre-registered. One side-effect of moving away from a static C++ structure as the representation of the configuration to a dynamic structure such as a tree is that the compiler cannot longer validate the name of the configuration settings when they are queried.  In the past, doing something like config.architecture would only compile if architecture was a valid structure defined... but now, code like config["architecture"] cannot be validated during the build.In order to overcome this limitation, trees must have their keys pre-defined.  Pre-defining the keys declares their type within the tree. &nbsp;Accesses to unknown keys results in an error right away, and accesses to pre-defined keys must always happen with their pre-recorded types.Note that pre-defined nodes can, or cannot, hold a value. The concept of "being set" is different than "being defined".Some nodes can be dynamic. Sometimes we do not know what particular keys are valid within a context. For example, the test_suites subtree of the configuration can contain arbitrary test suite names and properties within it, and there is no way for Kyua (at the moment) to know what keys are valid or not.As a result, the tree class allows defining a particular node as "dynamic", at which point accesses to any undefined keys below that node result in the creation of the node.Type safety. Every node has a type attached to it. The base configuration library provides common types such as bool_node, int_node and string_node, but the consumer can define its own node types to hold any other kind of data type.  (It'd be possible, for example, to define a map_node to hold a full map as a tree leaf.)The "tricky" (and cool) part of type safety in this context is to avoid exposing type casts to the caller: the caller always knows what type corresponds to every key (because, remember, the caller had to predefine them!), so it knows what type to expect from every node. The tree class achieves this by using template methods, which just query the generic internal nodes and cast them out (after validation) to the requested type.Plain string representations. The end user has to be able to provide overrides to configuration properties through the command line... and the command line is untyped: everything is a string.  The tree library, therefore, needs a mechanism to internalize strings (after validation) and convert them to the particular node types.  Similarly, it is interesting to have a way to export the contents of a tree to strings so that they can be shown to the user.With that said, let's see a couple of examples.  First, a simple one. Let's create a tree with a couple of fictitious nodes (one a string, one an integer), set some values and then query such values:config::tree tree;// Predefine the valid keys.tree.define&lt; config::string_node &gt;("kyua.architecture");tree.define&lt; config::int_node &gt;("kyua.timeout");// Populate the tree with some sample values.tree.set&lt; config::string_node &gt;("kyua.architecture", "powerpc");tree.set&lt; config::int_node &gt;("kyua.timeout", 300);// Query the sample values.const std::string architecture =    tree.lookup&lt; config::string_node &gt;("kyua.architecture");const int timeout =    tree.lookup&lt; config::int_node &gt;("kyua.timeout");Yep, that's it.  Note how the code just knows about keys and their types, but does not have to mess around with type casts nor tree nodes. And, if there is any typo in the property names or if there is a type mismatch between the property and its requested node type, the code will fail early. This, coupled with extensive unit tests, ensures that configuration keys are always queried consistently.Note that we'd also have set the keys above as follows:tree.set_string("kyua.architecture", "powerpc");tree.set_string("kyua.timeout", "300");... which would result in the validation of "300" as a proper integer, conversion of it to a native integer, and storing the resulting number as the integer node it corresponds to.  This is useful, again, when reading configuration overrides from the command line as types are not known in that context yet we want to store their values in the same data structure as the values read from the configuration file.Let's now see another very simple example showcasing dynamic nodes (which is a real-life example from the current Kyua configuration file):config::tree tree;// Predefine a subtree as dynamic.tree.define_dynamic("test_suites");// Populate the subtree with fictitious values.tree.set&lt; config::string_node &gt;("test_suites.NetBSD.ffs", "ext2fs");tree.set&lt; config::int_node &gt;("test_suites.NetBSD.iterations", 5);// And the querying would happen exactly as above with lookup().Indeed, it'd be very cool if this tree type followed more standard STL conventions (iterators, for example).  But I didn't really think about this when I started writing this class and, to be honest, I don't need this functionality.Now, if you paid close attention to the above, you can start smelling the relation of this structure to the syntax of configuration files. I'll tell you how this ties together with Lua in a later post. (Which may also explain why I chose this particular representation.)

        In the&nbsp;previous blog post, I described the problems that the implementation of the Kyua configuration file parsing and in-memory representation posed. I also hinted that some new code was coming and, after weeks of work, I'm happy to say that it has just landed in the tree!I really want to get to explaining the nitty-gritty details of the implementation, but I'll keep these for later. Let's focus first on what the goals for the new configuration module were, as these drove a lot of the implementation details:Key/value pairs representation: The previous configuration system did this already, and it is a pretty good form for a configuration file because it is a simple, understandable and widespread format. Note that I have not said anything yet about the types&nbsp;of the values.Tree-like representation: The previous configuration schema grouped test-suite specific properties under a "test_suites" map while it left internal run-time properties in the global namespace. The former is perfect and the latter was done just for simplicity. I want to move towards a tree of properties to give context to each of them so that they can be grouped semantically (e.g. kyua.report.*, kyua.runtime.*, etc.). The new code has not changed the structure of the properties yet (to remain compatible with previous files), but it adds very simple support to change this in the shortcoming future.Single-place parsing and validation: A configuration file is an external representation of a set of properties. This data is read (parsed) once and converted into an in-memory representation. All validation of the values of the properties must happen at this stage, and not when the properties are queried. The reason is that validation of external values must be consistent and has to happen in a controlled location (so that errors can all be reported at the same time).I have seen code in other projects where the configuration file is stored in memory as a set of key/value string pairs and parsing to other types (such as integers, etc.) is delayed until the values are used. The result is that, if a property is queried more than once, the validation will be implemented in different forms, each with its own bugs, which will result in dangerous inconsistencies.Type safety: This is probably the trickiest bit. Every configuration node must be stored in the type that makes most sense for its value. For example: a timeout in seconds is an integer, so the in-memory representation must be an integer. Or another example: the type describing the "unprivileged user" is a data structure that maps to a system user, yet the configuration file just specifies either a username or a UID.Keeping strict type validation in the code is interesting because it helps to ensure that parsing and validation happen in just a single place: whenever the configuration file is read, every property will have to be converted to its in-memory type, and this means that the validation can only happen at that particular time. Once the data is in memory, we can and have to assume that it is valid. Additionally, strict types ensure that the code querying such properties uses the values as intended, without having to do additional magic to map them to other types.Extensibility: Parsing a configuration file is a very generic concept, yet the previous code made the mistake of tying this logic with the specific details of Kyua configuration files. A goal of the new code has been to write a library that parses configuration files, and allows the Kyua-specific code to define the schema of the configuration file separately. (No, the library is not shipped separately at this point; it's placed in its own utils::config module.)With all this code in place, there are a bunch of things that can now be easily implemented. Consider the following:Properties to define the timeout of test cases depending on their size (long-standing issue 5).Properties to tune the UI behavior: width of the screen, whether to use color or not (no, there is no color support yet), etc.Properties to configure how reports look like "by default": if you generate reports of any form frequently, it is very likely that you will want them to look the same every time and hence you will want to define the report settings once in the configuration file.Hooks: one of the reasons for using Lua-based configuration files was to allow providing extra customization abilities to the user. Kyua could theoretically call back into Lua code to perform particular actions, and such actions could be explicitly stated by the user in the form of Lua functions. Neither the current configuration code nor Kyua has support for hooks, but the new implementation makes it rather easy to add them.And that's all for today. Now that you know what the current code is trying to achieve and why, we will be able to look at how the implementation does all this in the next posts.

        A couple of years ago, when Kyua was still a newborn, I wrote a very ad-hoc solution for the parsing and representation of its configuration files. The requirements for the configuration were minimal, as there were very few parameters to be exposed to the user. The implementation was quick and simple to allow further progress on other more-important parts of the project. (Yep, quick is an euphemism for dirty: the implementation of the "configuration class" has to special-case properties everywhere to deal with their particular types... just as the Lua script has to do too.)As I just mentioned in the previous paragraph, the set of parameters exposed through the configuration file were minimal. Let's recap what these are:Run-time variables: architecture and platform, which are two strings identifying the system; and unprivileged_user, which (if defined) is the name of the user under which to run unprivileged tests as. It is important to mention that the unprivileged_user is internally represented by a data type that includes several properties about a system user, and that it ensures that the data it contains is valid at all times. The fact that every property holds a specific type is an important design requirement.Test suite variables: every test suite can accept arbitrary configuration variables. Actually, these are defined by the test programs themselves. All of these properties are strings (and cannot be anything else because ATF test programs have no way of indicating the type of the configuration variables they accept/expect).Because of the reduced set of configurable properties, I opted to implement the configuration of the program as a simple data structure with one field per property, and a map of properties to represent the arbitrary test suite variables. The "parser" to populate this structure consists on a Lua module that loads these properties from a Lua script. The module hooks into the Lua metatables to permit things like "test_suites.NetBSD.timeout=20" to work without having to predeclare the intermediate tables.Unfortunately, as I keep adding more and more functionality to Kyua, I encounter additional places where a tunable would be appreciated by the end user (e.g. "disallow automatic line wrapping"). Exposing such tunable through a command-line flag would be a possibility, but some of these need to be permanent in order to be useful. It is clear that these properties have to be placed in the configuration file, and attempting to add them to the current codebase shows that the current abstractions in Kyua are not flexible enough.So, why am I saying all this? Well: during the last few weeks, I have been working on a new configuration module for Kyua. The goals have been simple:Have a generic configuration module that parses configuration files only, without any semantics about Kyua (e.g. what variables are valid or not). This ensures that the implementation is extensible and at the right level of abstraction.Be able to get rid of the ad-hoc parsing of configuration files.Allow defining properties in a strictly-typed tree structure. Think about being able to group properties by function, e.g. "kyua.host.architecture"; this is more or less what we have today for test-suite properties but the implementation is a special-case again and cannot be applied to other tunables.And...  I am pleased to say that this code is about to get merged into the tree just in time for Kyua 0.4. In the next few posts, I will explain what the particular design constraints of this new configuration system were and outline a little bit its implementation. I think it's a pretty cool hack that mixes C++ data structures and Lua scripts in a "transparent" manner, albeit you may think it's too &nbsp;complex. The key part is that, as this new configuration module is not specific to Kyua, you might want to borrow the code/ideas for your own use!

        For the last couple of weeks, particularly during a bunch of long flights, I have been improving the command-line user interface of Kyua by implementing controlled line wrappings on screen boundaries: messages that are too long to fit on the screen are preprocessed and split into multiple lines at word boundaries. This affects informational messages, error messages and, specially, the output of the built-in help command.I originally got this idea from Monotone and later implemented it into ATF but, when writing Kyua's code, I decided to postpone its implementation until a later stage. Reusing the code from ATF was not "nice" because the API of the formatting code was quite nasty, and reimplementing this feature during the initial stages of Kyua felt like a waste of time.However, because controlled line wrapping is crucial to having readable built-in help messages, I have had to do this eventually and the time finally came.The ATF approachWhy did I say that the ATF code for line wrapping was quite nasty? The main reason is that the printing of messages was incredibly tied to their wrapping. All the code in ATF that prints a message to the screen has to deal with the line wrapping itself, which involves dealing with too many presentation details.For example, consider the help routine that prints the table of options and their descriptions. This routine has to calculate the width of the longest option first and then, for every option, output its name, output some padding, and output the description properly refilled so that subsequent lines are properly arranged with respect to the previous one. While this may not sound too bad in writing, it actually is in code.Furthermore, because all this formatting logic is spread out throughout the code, there is no way to perform decent unit testing. The unit testing did some basic tests on input text, but could not validate that more complex constructions were working right.The Kyua approachIn the Kyua codebase, I decided to take a more declarative and functional approach. Smaller, pure building blocks that can be combined to achieve more complex constructions and that can be easily tested for correctness individually or in combination.I started by implementing a simple function that takes a paragraph and reformats it to any given length. This simple function alone gives full flexibility to the caller to decide how to later merge this reformatted text with other text: e.g. place a line prefix or bundle such text inside a table cell.The next step was to implement tables. Code wishing to print, e.g. the collection of options/commands along their descriptions only cares about declaring a table of two columns and N rows; why should it bother about properly lining up the two columns and printing them? It doesn't, hence the table approach. With tables, the caller can just decide which particular column needs to be wrapped if the table does not fit on the screen, and allow the formatting code to do this. Plus, having this higher level constructs means that we can eventually print the textual reports in a nicer, tabulated way (not done yet).And the last step was to mix all these higher level constructs into the&nbsp;console frontend class. This class (the ui) knows how to query the width of the terminal and knows how to fit certain kinds of text and/or tables within such width. For example, error messages are not tables: they are messages prefixed with the command name; only the message has to be reformatted if it does not fit while the rest of the text has to flow after the command name. Or, for tables, the maximum width of the terminal determines how wide the table can be and thus how much one of its columns has to be refilled.Getting this whole thing right working has proven to be extremely tricky and I'm sure there are still quite a few rough edges to be discovered. That said, it has been fun enough :-) &nbsp;But, after this experience, I certainly don't want to imagine the pain that the writers of HTML/CSS renderers have endured... this text-based table-rendering is trivial compared to what web browsers do!

        Lately, three long trips (5 hours in a bus, and 6 and 10 hours in two planes) have allowed me to work on the long-promised HTML reporting feature of Kyua. The result of these three trips is, effectively, the ability to generate HTML reports for specific test actions!The current results are extremely rudimentary&nbsp;(they lack tons of would-be-useful information) and not that aesthetically pleasing. However, the database already records enough information to make these reports more useful and pretty, so "all that is left" is coming up with the necessary code to extract such information in an efficient way and spending time creating a visually-nicer appearance. None of these are as trivial as they sound, but I prefer to work one step at a time (i.e. coming up first with a very rough draft and improve it later) rather than keeping the feature private until it is "perfect".Without further ado, you can take a look at the report of the execution of the NetBSD test suite. This output comes from my NetBSD-current virtual machine, and I've set up a couple of cron jobs to keep it up to date. (If the "action X" in the title does not increase periodically, you will know that something is broken on my side. I found that the VM already crashed, so I don't know for how long it will run now after a restart...)

        I finally took the plunge. Yesterday night, I migrated the Kyua and Lutok repositories from Subversion to Git. And this morning I migrated ATF from Monotone and custom hosting to Git and Google Code; oh, and this took way longer than expected.Migration of Kyua and LutokMigrating these two projects was straightforward. After preparing a fresh local Git repository following the instructions posted yesterday, pushing to Google Code is a simple matter:$ git remote add googlecode https://code.google.com/p/your-project$ git push googlecode --all$ git push googlecode --tagsOne of the nice things I discovered while doing this is that a Google Code project supports multiple repositories when the VCS system is set to Git or Mercurial. By default, the system creates the default and wiki repositories, but you can add more at will. This is understandable given that, in Subversion, you have the ability to check out individual directories of a project whereas you cannot do that in the other supported VCSs: you actually need different repositories to group different parts of the project.I performed the full migration under a Linux box so that I could avail of the most recent Git version along with a proven binary package. The migration went alright, but I encountered a little problem when attempting a fresh checkout from NetBSD: git under NetBSD will not work correctly against SSL servers because it lacks the necessary CA certificates. The solution is to install the security/mozilla-rootcerts package and follow the instructions printed during installation; why this does not happen automatically escapes my mind.Migration of ATFI had been having doubts about migrating ATF itself, although if Kyua was moved to Git, it was a prerequisite to move ATF as well. &nbsp;Certainly I could convert the repository to Git, but where could I host it afterwards? &nbsp;Creating a new Google Code project just for this seemed too much of a hassle. My illumination came when I found out, as above, that Google Code supports an arbitrary amount of repositories in a particular project when converting it to Git.So, for ATF, I just ran mtn git_export with appropriate flags, created a new atf repository on the Kyua site, and pushed the contents there. Along the way, I also decided to kill the home-grown ATF web site and replace it by a single page containing all the relevant information. At this point, ATF and Kyua are supposed to work together quite tightly (in the sense that ATF is just a "subcomponent" of Kyua), so coupling the two projects on the same site makes sense.Now, let's drink the kool aid.

        As discussed over a week ago, I have been pondering the idea of migrating my projects from Subversion to Git.  One of the prerequisites of such a migration is the preparation of a process to cleanly migrate the revision history from the old system to the new one.  Of course, such process should attempt to preserve the revision history as close to reality as possible (regardless of what some other big projects have done by just throwing away their history; shrug).The projects I am interested in migrating from Subversion to Git all live in Google Project Hosting.  This is irrelevant for all but one detail I will mention later.  However, the project hosting's site is the obvious place to look for help and, as expected, there is a little document titled Convert your project from Subversion to Git that provides a good start.Summarizing, there are two well-suited tools to convert a Subversion repository to Git:The built-in git svn command: works pretty well and has a good amount of customization features. The only little problem is that git svn does not recognize Subversion tags as such and therefore converts them to Git branches instead of tags.The third-party svn2git: while this is actually built on top of git svn, it properly handles Subversion tags and converts them to native Git tags.If you do not have tags in your Subversion repository or do not care about them being properly converted to Git tags, you can go with git svn.  However, I am interested in properly recording tags, so I chose svn2git for my needs.Now, using svn2git by itself as instructed in the referenced document will happily convert your Subversion repository to Git.  You should not have to care about anything else... unless you want to polish a few details mentioned below.Set upIn the rest of this article, I will place all the scripts for the conversion in a ~/convert/ directory.  When the script is run, it will create a ./git/ subdirectory that will end up containing the new Git repository, and a ./control/ directory that will maintain temporary control files.Disclaimer: Be aware that all the code below is quite ugly and probably bug-ridden.  It is not meant to be pretty as I only have two use cases for it.  Also please note that I am, by no means, a Git expert, so the process below may be way more convoluted than is actually necessary.Oh, and this does not deal at all with the wiki changes.  Google Code stores such information in the same Subversion repository as your code.  However, when migrating to Git, you get two different repositories.  Adapting the code below to deal with the wiki component of your project should be easy enough, although I'm not sure I care enough about the few contents I have in the wikis to go through the hassle.Warning: The instructions below completely mess up tags if you happen to have any in your repository. I only discovered this after following the procedure below and pushing HEAD and the tags, which resulted in a different set of revisions pushed for every tag. When I actually did this, I ended up running the steps below, then discarding the tags, and creating the tags again by hand pointing to the appropriate revisions.Setting up authorsThe first step in using svn2git is defining a mapping between Subversion authors to Git authors.  This is easy enough, but there is one caveat that affects projects hosted in Google Code: the root revision of your Subversion repository is not actually authored by you; its author is (no author) so you should account for that.  Something like this in your ~/.svn2git/authors file will tae care of this teeny tiny detail:your-address@example.net = Your Name (no author) = Your Name However, as we will see below, we will be skipping the first revision of the repository altogether so this is actually not really necessary.  I just felt like mentioning it for completeness, given that I really didn't expect (no author) to be properly recognized in this context.References to old Subversion revision idsUnless you have been extremely terse in your commit history and in your bug tracker, you will have plenty of cross-references pointing to Subversion revision identifiers.  For example, if you are fixing a bug introduced a month ago in r123, you may as well point that out in the commit message of r321 for reference purposes.  I guess you can see the problem now: if we migrate the history "as is", all these references become meaningless because the new Git history has no traces of the old revision identifiers.The -m option to svn2git will annotate every revision with a git-svn-id line that contains the relevant information.  However, such line is quite ugly because it is not really meant for human consumption: the information in such line is used by git-svn to allow pulls and pushes from a master Subversion repository.What I want to do is reword the git-svn-id line to turn it into a real sentence rather than some internal control code.  We can achieve this with git rebase in interactive mode: mark all revisions as "reword" and then go revision by revision fixing its message.  A pain that can be automated: if an editor can do the necessary changes, we can create a fake "editor" script that performs the same modifications.How?  Store this as ~/convert/editor1.sh:#! /bin/shif grep git-svn-id "${1}"; then    # We are editing a commit message.    new="This revision was r\1 in Subversion."    sed -r -i -e "s,git-svn-id[^@]+@([0-9]+).*$,${new}," "${1}"else    # We are editing the git-rebase interactive control file.    sed -i -e 's,^pick,reword,' "${1}"fiWith this script, we can simply do EDITOR=~/convert/editor1.sh git rebase -i base-revision and get every revision tagged... but this will blow up if your repository contains empty revisions, which takes us to the next concern.Drop empty revisionsAs you probably know, Subversion supports attaching metadata to directories and files in the form of properties.  These properties cannot be represented in Git, so, if you have any Subversion commits that touched properties alone, svn2git will happily convert those as empty Git commits.There is nothing wrong with this, but things like git rebase will choke on these empty commits over and over again... and it gets quite annoying.  Furthermore, these empty commits serve no purpose in Git because the changes they performed in Subversion make no sense in Git land.  It is easier to just kill them all from the history.The git rebase command above will abort on every empty revision it encounters.  We can, at that point, record their identifiers for later deletion.  However, recording the revision identifier will not work because, as we are doing a rebase, the identifier will have changed once we are done.  Instead, and because I have been careful to write detailed commit messages, we can rely on the first line of the message (aka the subject) to identify every message.  Rerun the rebase as follows, storing the list of empty commits in ../control/empty:first=$(git log | grep '^commit' | tail -n 1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2)EDITOR="${convert}/editor1.sh"     git rebase --interactive "${first}" || truetouch ../control/emptywhile [ -f .git/MERGE_MSG ]; do    head -n 1 .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG &gt;&gt;../control/empty    EDITOR="${convert}/editor1.sh" git commit --allow-empty    EDITOR="${convert}/editor1.sh" git rebase --continue || truedoneWith this list in mind, we create another ~/convert/editor2.sh script to remove the empty revisions once we know them:#! /bin/shecho "Empty revisions to be deleted:"cat ../control/empty | while read line; do    grep "${line}" "${1}"    sed -i -e "/^pick ${line}$/s,^pick,fixup," "${1}"doneAmend the root revisionThe root revision in a Google Code subversion repository is empty: the system creates it to initialize the "directory layout" of your repository, but it serves no purpose.  We can skip this root revision by passing the --revision=2 flag to svn2git.However, no matter what we do, the git rebase above to tag Git revisions with their corresponding Subversion identifiers, will happily skip our first real revision and leave it untagged.  We have to manually go and fix this, which is actually quite tricky.  Luckily, this reply in stackoverflow provides the solution.Putting it all togetherAlright then.  If all the above was dense and cryptic code-wise, it is the time to put it all together in a script that performs all the steps for us.  Assuming you already have ~/convert/editor1.sh and ~/convert/editor2.sh in place, now create ~/convert/driver.sh as follows:#! /bin/shset -e -x[ ${#} -eq 1 ] || exit 1convert=$(dirname ${0})project=${1}rm -rf git controlmkdir git controlcd git# Start at revision 2 to skip the initial empty revision.svn2git -v --revision=2 -m "http://${project}.googlecode.com/svn"# Tag git revisions with the original Subversion revision id.first=$(git log | grep '^commit' | tail -n 1 | cut -d ' ' -f 2)EDITOR="${convert}/editor1.sh"     git rebase --interactive "${first}" || truetouch ../control/emptywhile [ -f .git/MERGE_MSG ]; do    head -n 1 .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG &gt;&gt;../control/empty    EDITOR="${convert}/editor1.sh" git commit --allow-empty    EDITOR="${convert}/editor1.sh" git rebase --continue || truedone# Drop empty revisions recorded in the previous step.# The list is in the 'empty' file and is read by editor2.sh.EDITOR="${convert}/editor2.sh"     git rebase --interactive "${first}" || true# Tag the root revision with the original Subversion revision id.git tag root $(git rev-list HEAD | tail -1)git checkout -b new-root rootEDITOR="${convert}/editor1.sh" git commit --amendgit checkout @{-1}git rebase --onto new-root rootgit branch -d new-rootgit tag -d rootcd -rm -rf controlYuck.  Well, it works, and it works nicely.  Converting a Subversion repository to Git will all the constraints above is now as easy as: ~/convert/driver.sh your-project-name!
