</a><a href=/feed.xml><img src=/images/badges/feed-icon-28x28.png alt="RSS feed"></a></p></div></div></div><hr><p>To answer this question, I&rsquo;d like to imagine what would happen if we were to use Rust in a large team (say tens of people) that deals with a large codebase (hundreds of thousands of SLoC).</p><p>The reason I pick this scenario is <em>totally</em> unrelated (wink, wink) to the work I do on a day-to-day basis in Azure Storage. Our current codebase is written in C++ and has its fair share of NPEs and concurrency bugs, so we have sometimes <del>argued</del> fantasized with the idea of adopting Rust.</p><p>An obvious concern that arises is that adding a new language to a large project is&mldr; very difficult: fighting inertia, bringing up tooling, training people, porting code <a href=https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/>without a rewrite</a>&mldr; these are all very hard work items. But there is a more subtle worry: even if we went through this whole endeavor, would our developer population be able to learn enough Rust to contribute to the codebase in a meaningful way? The language is, again, complex at first sight, and we should not expect everyone to master it.</p><p>The first observation is that, in a sufficiently large team, we will have developers with various levels of expertise no matter the language. This is expected and intentional, but depending on the language, the consequences are different. For example: C++ is <em>also</em> a very complex language. Sure, it may be easier to <em>write</em> than Rust because the compiler is more forgiving, but it&rsquo;s also much harder to guarantee its correctness. This comes back to bite the developer team at a later point, because now you need to call the experts to debug crashes and race conditions.</p><p>The second observation comes from my writing of side projects in Rust. I&rsquo;m finding that the majority of my time goes into writing straightforward business logic and refactoring tests, for which Rust doesn&rsquo;t get in the way. It&rsquo;s only during certain parts of the project&rsquo;s lifetime that I&rsquo;ve had to build the foundations (abstractions, layering, async constructs, etc.) or done large redesigns, and it&rsquo;s only during those times that I&rsquo;ve had my fights with Rust.</p><p>In other words: given a sufficiently large project or team, and irrespective of the language, there will always be a set of core maintainers that design, write and maintain the foundations. This set of people knows the ins and outs of the project and should know the ins and outs of the language and its ecosystem. This set of people is <em>necessary</em>. But once these foundations are in place, all other contributors can focus on the exciting aspects of building features. Rust&rsquo;s complexities may still get in the way, but not much more than those of other languages.</p><p>To conclude, I would like you to <a href=/2022/04/do-rust-devs-hate-go-devs.html>consider again</a> that learning a language is not just a matter of learning its syntax. Mastering a programming language requires months of expertise with the language&rsquo;s idiosyncrasies and its libraries, and one must go through these before making comparisons about long-term maintainability. But yes, Rust could be simpler, and there are <a href=https://tim.mcnamara.nz/post/683022094467039232/easy-mode-for-rust>efforts to make it so</a>!</p><p>Finally, a question for you. I haven&rsquo;t had the fortune (?) of working in a large-scale Rust project yet, so all I&rsquo;m doing is hypothesizing here based on experiences with other languages in large projects and teams. If you have converted a team into Rust, or if you were brought in to contribute to an existing Rust codebase, would you mind sharing your experience below? :)</p></article></div></div><div class="container post-links"><div class=row><div class="col mr-auto text-left"><span><a href=https://jmmv.dev/2022/04/do-rust-devs-hate-go-devs.html>&#171; Previous</a></span></div><div class="col text-center"><span><a href=/archive.html>All posts</a></span></div><div class="col ml-auto text-right"><span><a href=https://jmmv.dev/2022/05/remembering-buildtool.html>Next &#187;</a></span></div></div></div><div class="container post-votes"><div class=row><div class="col-lg-4 my-2"><div class=row><div class=col><a onclick=voteThumbsUp() class="btn btn-block btn-outline-success" id=thumbs-up-btn>👍
