Most changes have focused on the core language, but they also spread to the standard library and the user interface. To summarize, these are the main changes in this release:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Support for <code>GOTO</code> <em>and</em> <code>GOSUB</code>.</strong> Implementing these required dropping the previous AST-based evaluator and replacing it with a bytecode-based executor (with an associated compiler). You can read more about this change in &ldquo;<a href=/2022/11/endbasic-bytecode.html>From AST to bytecode execution in EndBASIC</a>&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p><strong>Error catching and handling via <code>ON ERROR</code>.</strong> This was also made possible by the new bytecode executor mentioned earlier.</p></li><li><p><strong>Precise line and column numbers in every error message.</strong> This required a massive overhaul of how the AST is represented to carry these details in every node. Modifying the AST was relatively easy&mldr; but adjusting all existing tests to validate this new information was extremely laborious.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interop of numeric types.</strong> Being strict about numeric types was nice in theory&mdash;just as it is a very welcome pedantic feature in Rust&mdash;but the lack of automatic conversions between integers and doubles was&mldr; quite annoying. As a consequence, this release brings transparent promotion of integers to doubles and automatic rounding of doubles to integers. This works now but I feel it&rsquo;s a hack due to all of the special-casing that has taken place. A more advanced bytecode will probably make this better in the future.</p></li><li><p><strong>Revamped interactive help system.</strong> Previous versions provided a <code>HELP</code> command that exposed documentation for all high-level types, but failed to provide documentation about the language itself (other than for a simplified cheat-sheet that grew too cryptic and long). This release has fixed this by extending <code>HELP</code> to provide language-specific documentation.</p></li><li><p><strong>New control flow structures.</strong> These include suppport for <code>DO</code> loops (with all of their variants, which include infinite loops as well as <code>WHILE</code> and <code>UNTIL</code> clauses before or after the loop), <code>SELECT CASE</code>, and one-line <code>IF</code>s. <code>SELECT CASE</code> is probably the hardest structure that exists right now due to the oddities in its grammar and the many cases to consider.</p></li><li><p><strong>Addition of bitwise operators.</strong> These are a nice-to-have, and because these are now available, the language now supports specifying integer literals in binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal bases.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rename of <code>EXIT</code> to <code>END</code> to terminate programs.</strong> This seems like a triviality, but it&rsquo;s worth mentioning because it was quite difficult to retrofit it into the parser due to how <code>END</code> is sometimes a statement on its own and other times it is combined with other keywords (e.g. <code>END IF</code> or <code>END SELECT</code>). Stay tuned for an upcoming post that will deep dive into the parsing oddities of this language.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lots of small tweaks here and there.</strong> These include fixes to the editor, minor changes to the grammar, command renames, addition of exponents and square roots, addition of various new string functions, and addition of a way to query the screen size to let <del>games</del> programs adjust to different viewports.</p></li></ul><p>Quite a few changes, huh? :)</p><h1 id=how-can-i-enjoy-this>How can I enjoy this?</h1><p>Here are the usual links to get you started:</p><ul><li><p><strong><a href=https://repl.endbasic.dev/>Launch the online interpreter</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href=https://www.endbasic.dev/>Visit the EndBASIC website</a></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><a href=https://github.com/endbasic/endbasic/releases/tag/endbasic-0.9.0>Read the release notes</a></strong></p></li></ul><p>Please <a href=mailto:support@endbasic.dev>let me know</a> if you have any questions, feedback, or encounter any issues. There are tons more things I wanted to continue tweaking and fixing before publishing 0.10, but I had to force myself to get it out of the door already. There will always be a next release to fix stuff.</p><p>With that, I&rsquo;ll leave you with a demo to display some holiday greetings, all written in EndBASIC and leveraging the new features in this release 😊</p><iframe id=terminal src="https://repl.endbasic.dev/?run=jmmv/flakes.bas"></iframe><p>&mldr; and if you have made it this far, you can also:</p><ul><li>play a <a href="https://repl.endbasic.dev/?run=jmmv/arka.bas">work-in-progress Arkanoid clone</a> and</li><li>play a <a href="https://repl.endbasic.dev/?run=jmmv/snake.bas">Snake clone</a>.</li></ul></article></div></div><div class="container post-links"><div class=row><div class="col mr-auto text-left"><span><a href=https://jmmv.dev/2022/11/endbasic-bytecode.html>&#171; Previous</a></span></div><div class="col text-center"><span><a href=/archive.html>All posts</a></span></div><div class="col ml-auto text-right"><span><a href=https://jmmv.dev/2023/01/endbasic-parsing-difficulties.html>Next &#187;</a></span></div></div></div><div class="container post-votes"><div class=row><div class="col-lg-4 my-2"><div class=row><div class=col><a onclick=voteThumbsUp() class="btn btn-block btn-outline-success" id=thumbs-up-btn>👍
