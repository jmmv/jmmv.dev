        <p>Subcommand-based interfaces are common: the majority of the CLI tools that provide more than one operation within them expose their features in this manner.  Examples of such interfaces include <tt>svn</tt>, <tt>git</tt>, <tt>ifconfig</tt>, <tt>yum</tt>, <tt>apt-get</tt> and many, many more.</p> <p>Designing the interface of these applications is quite straightforward once you have the concepts clear, but there are quite a few common pitfalls that you need to be aware of to prevent falling into them.  In this post, I will guide you through what the general design of such interfaces is and I will cover a bunch of the common problems.  Let's get started.</p> <p><b>General syntax</b></p> <p>The general syntax of a subcommand-based interface is simple:</p> <pre>tool [general options] command [command options] [command arguments]</pre> <p>where square brackets denote optionality as usual.</p> <p>There are two extremely important takeaways from this definition:</p> <ul> <li>Anything that comes <i>before</i> <tt>command</tt> must be applicable to <i>all</i> the commands and cannot change the behavior of any individual command without also changing the others.</li> <li>Anything that comes <i>after</i> <tt>command</tt> is specific to that command and that command only.</li> </ul> <p>It is your responsibility to make this distinction explicit in the implementation of your interface.  In general, this is easy as <a href="/2013/08/cli-design-do-not-reinvent-option.html">most command-line parsing libraries</a> will let you chunk your command-line parsing in the two distinct blocks.</p> <p>However, I must call your attention to GNU Getopt's odd behavior in that, by default, it does not stop searching for options once it encounters the first non-option argument.  This makes the chunking of generic options vs. command-specific options trickier, but not impossible.  To get GNU Getopt to behave as expected, you need to select POSIX-compliant behavior as described in the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt.html">GNU Getopt manual</a>.  Unfortunately, doing so causes incompatibilities with other implementations so you may need a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/browse/m4/getopt.m4?spec=svn.testers.1b82d0fe146031526b73454cc64bca7ee1f5b87a&repo=testers&r=97d47392460ad5c820f0b316a7012104b5cd6168#30">nasty Autoconf check to detect this situation</a> if you want to remain portable.</p> <p><b>Repetition is OK</b></p> <p>In a subcommand-based application, it is common for a group of —but not all!— subcommands to require similar pieces of information.  In this situation, it is perfectly fine the implement the same option as a command-specific option in all the subcommands that take it.</p> <p>Let's consider the interface of Kyua as an example.  In this interface, we have generic commands like <tt>help</tt> and <tt>config</tt> that do not access the test database, and commands like <tt>test</tt> and <tt>report</tt> that do access it.  All of the subcommands that read from or write to the tests database need a path to the database, and because this path has a reasonable default, it makes sense to <a href="/2013/08/cli-design-putting-flags-to-good-use.html">let the user tune the path via a flag</a>.</p> <p>A common temptation would be to offer the interface just described as:</p> <pre>kyua [--store=file] config|debug|help|test</pre> <p>but that would be a really poor choice.  This interface definition implies that the <tt>--store</tt> flag applies to <i>all</i> of the subcommands, which is not true.  <tt>help</tt> and <tt>config</tt> wouldn't care less about the path to the database file and, effectively, providing that flag to these commands would have no visible effect.</p> <p>A better definition would be the following:</p> <pre>kyua config|help<br />kyua debug|test [--store=file]</pre> <p>which very clearly denotes what each subcommand is affected by.  It is therefore OK to expose a subset of flags across various subcommands as long as those flags are specific to the subcommands.</p> <p>So why do you often see invalid interfaces like the former?  Because it is much easier to implement them: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/browse/cli.c?spec=svn.testers.1b82d0fe146031526b73454cc64bca7ee1f5b87a&repo=testers&r=41b14d0f2d6fe084ba0ece7b5609bdf7559f5e67#109">calling getopt twice is not as easy as it may seem</a>.</p> <p>Lastly, there are two additional details to keep in mind: first, make sure that the behavior of such options is exactly the same in all of the commands in which it exists; and, second, reuse the parsing code as much as possible.</p> <p><b>Requesting help</b></p> <p>In a previous post, we learned that <a href="/2013/08/cli-design-requesting-and-offering-help.html">the user should only be shown help when he explicitly requests it</a>.  So how do we expose this in a subcommand-based interface?</p> <p>Easy: asking the program to show help is a <i>completely different behavior</i> than that of any other command.  For this reason, the only reasonable approach to fit the request for help in the design of a subcommand-based interface is to offer the help as a <i>separate</i> subcommand which you can appropriately call <tt>help</tt>.</p> <p>Following this rationale, the simplistic form of the help request would be:</p> <pre>tool help</pre> <p>It is easy to imagine that we could extend this syntax to support additional functionality and thus offer a more complex builtin help system.  For example:</p> <pre>tool help [command name]</pre> <p>With this syntax, we could allow the user to request help on any individual subcommand.</p> <p>Be aware, however, that all of the following are <b>bad choices</b> yet they are quite widespread:</p> <pre>tool --help  # Abuses flags.<br />tool command --help  # Abuses flags.<br />tool --help command  # Abuses flags and their ordering.<br />tool command help  # help is not a subcommand of the command!</pre> <p><b>Requesting the version number</b></p> <p>Similarly to the previous point on how to request help, requesting the version number of the application is also a completely different behavior than anything else.  Consequently, this feature must be implemented as a separate subcommand.</p> <p>The only way you can fit the request for the version number in your subcommand-based application without break consistency is by implementing a syntax like this:</p> <pre>tool version</pre> <p>Or, if you want to generalize this, you could expose the version and other useful information (like license text, authors, etc.) in an <tt>about</tt> subcommand <a href="https://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/browse/cli/cmd_about.cpp">just like Kyua does</a>.</p> <p>But yes: exposing the request of the version number via a <tt>--version</tt> flag is wrong <i>in this type of interfaces</i>.</p> <hr/> <p>Subcommand-based interfaces are the most complex of CLI styles given that, conceptually, they bundle many tools under a single roof.  However, due to the flexibility in their design, it is possible to achieve a very straightforward and orthogonal interface with which users are already familiar with.</p> <p>In the next post, I will cover the simpler style of a CLI in which the tool only exposes a single command.  Things get slightly trickier there due to the additional implementation constraints.</p>
