non-distributed VCS needn&rsquo;t be hard. Some people handle this with Git,
but I use a tool that seems to have fallen in disuse but was once very
popular to create patchsets against the Linux kernel:
<a href=http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt>Quilt</a>.</p><p>What is Quilt? As the quilt(1) manual page says:</p><blockquote><p><strong>quilt</strong> - tool to manage series of patches</p><p>Quilt is a tool to manage large sets of patches by keeping track of
the changes each patch makes. Patches can be applied, un-applied,
refreshed, etc. The key philosophical concept is that your primary
output is patches.</p></blockquote><p>In other words: Quilt is a utility that lets you create and maintain
independent patches on top of a source tree. The patches you create may
all be interrelated (e.g. to provide different building blocks for a
bigger feature) and Quilt supports that via the concept of a stack, or
series, of patches.</p><p>To illustrate how to use Quilt in practice, I&rsquo;ll go over my workflow to
patch the FreeBSD source tree. The FreeBSD source tree is maintained in
a Subversion repository, which is non-distributed. This means that, if
you are not a committer, you have to provide your contributions via
patches. Some contributions are tricky enough that you should attempt to
submit them as a collection of simpler patches, for easier review and
incorporation. Similarly, and even if you are a committer, you may still
want to work on your feature offline while preparing the different
commits you will issue to the tree once you are ready: Subversion
branches are not lightweight enough to use them for smallish changes.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start.</p><h1 id=the-patches-directory>The patches directory</h1><p>Quilt stores all the patches you manage in a patches directory of your
choice. This directory is created the first time you create a patch (see
below) in the directory where you execute Quilt. From there on, Quilt
will look for this directory in the directory you currently are on in
any parent directory up to the root.</p><p>What all this means is that the first time you invoke Quilt to create a
patch, you should do so from the top-most directory of the source tree.
This will ensure that, no matter where you later invoke other Quilt
commands within that project, Quilt will use the same patches directory.</p><p>You can inspect the contents of the patches directory by hand if you
wish. If you do, you will notice that all it contains are your patches
plus a series file that indicates the order in which the patches need to
be applied. The data in this directory is all the information you need
to share your work with the world for review or submission.</p><h1 id=creating-a-new-patch>Creating a new patch</h1><p>Creating a new patch is easy: just use quilt new and give this command
the name of the patch file you are creating. You have to append the
.diff or .patch suffix to the name explicitly. Note that all this does
is register the existence of the patch, but the patch will so far be
empty. (If you are curious, you can check the contents of the .pc
directory that has just been created and that Quilt uses for internal
tracking.)</p><p>Keeping in mind what we saw in the previous section, you should create
your first patch by invoking Quilt from the top-level directory of the
source tree. For example:</p><pre><code>~$ cd /usr/src
/usr/src$ quilt new move-kyuafiles.diff
</code></pre><h1 id=registering-changes-into-the-patch>Registering changes into the patch</h1><p>Now that you have a new patch registered, you <em>must</em> tell Quilt which
files you are going to edit <strong>before editing them</strong>! This is different
to the majority of the version control systems as they are able to
discover this on their own (with the exception of Perforce which needs
to you manually &ldquo;open&rdquo; files upfront, albeit for different reasons).</p><p>To do this, you can use the quilt add command or the quilt edit command.
The former only registers a file for editing into the patch while the
latter invokes an editor for you.</p><pre><code>/usr/src$ quilt add lib/Makefile
/usr/src$ vim lib/Makefile
... hack, hack, hack existing file ...
/usr/src$ mkdir lib/tests
/usr/src$ quilt add lib/tests/Makefile
... hack, hack, hack new file ...
/usr/src$ vim lib/tests/Makefile
</code></pre><p>Yes: you can just edit the original files after telling Quilt you are
going to do so. And you can even create new files from scratch.</p><h1 id=preparing-the-patch>Preparing the patch</h1><p>Once are done with all the necessary changes to define your patch, it is
time to prepare it. There are two things to do here: the first is to
(re)generate the patch file to include all your changes; and the second
is to write a patch header to provide details on your patch. The latter
will be particularly useful if you share your patch for review later,
but you can even use the description as your commit log.</p><p>To regenerate the <em>current</em> patch file, use the quilt refresh command.
This has to be done explicitly for the files in the patches directory to
be updated. Until you do so, you won&rsquo;t see any files in there!</p><p>To edit the patch description, use quilt header -e. This will open an
editor for you and let you type the patch description, which is later
prepended to the patch file. Take the chance to <a href=/2013/08/top-5-tips-to-write-great-commit-log.html>write a good
description</a>.</p><p>So, for every patch you create:</p><pre><code>/usr/src$ quilt refresh
/usr/src$ quilt header -e
... write some text, save and exit ...
</code></pre><h1 id=walking-the-patch-series-up-and-down>Walking the patch series up and down</h1><p>All we have done so far is creating a <em>single</em> patch, which is easy, but
you could have done that as well by manually creating copies of the
files before editing them or simply by invoking svn diff on the source
tree. Why the hassle, then?</p><p>Where Quilt really shines is when you start defining various patches on
top of each other. For any non-trivial work you do, splitting your
changes into different commits is pretty much a requirement. Doing so
simplifies the initial review and also makes the history of the code
easier to understand.</p><p>OK, so how do we create a new patch that is &ldquo;detached&rdquo; from the previous
one? Easy! Invoke quilt new again. When you do that, you will get a
brand-new, empty patch on top of the stack that you can later populate.
But more importantly, don&rsquo;t forget now to also use quilt add on any
files that will be part of this new patch.</p><p>And here comes the really cool thing: the quilt push and quilt pop
commands. These two allow you to apply or unapply the top-most patchset
and thus let you go back and forth between the various patches to work
on them individually and at any time. In other words, it&rsquo;s just fine to
pop various patches, do some edits, do a refresh and then do the
corresponding pushes to get back to the top of the set. Ideal for when
you receive feedback on your patchset and you want to address the issues
before checking the code in.</p><p>Lastly, to know where you are at, use the quilt series command. This
will print the full list of existing patches and will use different
colors to show you which patches are applied, which patch you are
currently working on and which patches have not yet been applied. Play
with push, pop and series to see how things move along.</p><h1 id=caveats>Caveats</h1><p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not all roses. Quilt does not &ldquo;own&rdquo; your source tree
and, for this reason, it cannot know when you modify files without
telling Quilt upfront. As a result, it is relatively easy for unexpected
changes to sneak into your patch set. There are two things to keep in
mind that will prevent most uncomfortable moments.</p><p>The single most important thing you should remember is: <strong>DO NOT UPDATE
THE SOURCES WHILE THERE ARE PATCHES APPLIED!</strong> Doing so will confuse
your patch set and you&rsquo;ll have a hard time restoring it. The reason is
that a svn update may end up modifying the files you have <em>already</em>
changed, and those changes will appear to Quilt as if they were changes
of your own&mldr; which means they will be integrated into your patch
incorrectly. A quick quilt pop -a && svn update && quilt push -a should
do the trick though.</p><p>Also, if you intend to create a new patch to re-edit a file that you
<em>already</em> modified in another patch, do not forget to register the file
with quilt! Otherwise your changes won&rsquo;t be segregated into the two
different patches as you intended and you&rsquo;ll have to do this later&mldr;</p><hr><p>So there you go. You have no excuse now to contribute to open-source
projects by dumping single gigantic patches that are impossible to
understand nor review. Break your contributions apart. Your
collaboration experience will be much better and, hopefully, your
patches will be integrated much quicker.</p><p>And yes, most of this can also be achieved (ab)using Git. There goes an
idea for a future post.</p></article></div></div><div class="container post-links"><div class=row><div class="col mr-auto text-left"><span><a href=https://jmmv.dev/2013/11/how-to-add-mac-os-x-screensaver-to-dock.html>&#171; Previous</a></span></div><div class="col text-center"><span><a href=/archive.html>All posts</a></span></div><div class="col ml-auto text-right"><span><a href=https://jmmv.dev/2013/11/header-files-series-introduction.html>Next &#187;</a></span></div></div></div><div class="container post-votes"><div class=row><div class="col-lg-4 my-2"><div class=row><div class=col><a onclick=voteThumbsUp() class="btn btn-block btn-outline-success" id=thumbs-up-btn>👍
