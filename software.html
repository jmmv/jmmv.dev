<h1 id="authored-projects">Authored projects</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.highscore.de/boost/process/">Boost.Process</a></strong>: A flexible
framework for the C++ programming language to execute programs and manage
their corresponding processes.  This was a project developed under the Google
Summer of Code 2006 program and was later picked up by another developer who
maintains it to this day.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jmmv/endbasic/">EndBASIC</a></strong>: A BASIC-like language
interpreter inspired by Amstrad&rsquo;s Locomotive BASIC 1.1 and Microsoft&rsquo;s
QuickBASIC 4.5. Like the former, EndBASIC intends to provide an interactive
environment that seamlessly merges coding with immediate visual feedback.
Like the latter, EndBASIC offers higher-level programming constructs and
strong typing. The main idea behind EndBASIC is to provide a playground for
learning the foundations of programming in a simplified environment. Written
in Rust and originally developed during the COVID-19 confinement.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/~jmmv/etcutils/">etcutils</a></strong>: Standalone utilities to
manipulate some of the configuration files in <code>/etc</code> in a programmatic manner.
Designed to be integrated into packaging systems as a lightweight dependency.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/jmmv/kyua/">Kyua</a></strong>: A testing framework for
infrastructure software.  This is my star project and the one where I spend
most of my (very little) free time in.  Kyua is used, mostly, by FreeBSD to
run its operating system-wide test suite.  Kyua&rsquo;s parent project,
<a href="http://github.com/jmmv/atf/">ATF</a>, was developed under the Google Summer of
Code 2007 program.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/jmmv/lutok/">Lutok</a></strong>: A lightweight C++ API library for
the Lua programming language.  Lutok provides thin C++ wrappers around the Lua
C API and makes extensive use of RAII to prevent resource leakage, exposes
C++-friendly native data types, and reports errors via C++ exceptions.
Originally developed as part of Kyua but split into its own project due to
popular demand.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/jmmv/markdown2social/">Markdown2Social</a></strong>: Converts
simple Markdown documents to Google+ posts.  Written in Python.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/jmmv/nudgytimer/">Nudgy Timer</a></strong>: Time tracker for
Android that subtly pokes you every few minutes to help you figure out
where your precious time is going to.  Written in Java.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/jmmv/pkg_comp/">pkg_comp</a></strong> and
<strong><a href="http://github.com/jmmv/sandboxctl/">sandboxctl</a></strong>: A couple of utilities
to automatically build pkgsrc binary packages from source in a chroot-based
sandbox.  pkg_comp orchestrates the build using the pbulk build system and
sandboxctl implements the management of the chroot-based sandbox on a bunch
of different operating systems.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/jmmv/shtk/">Shell Toolkit (shtk)</a></strong>: Application toolkit
for programmers writing POSIX-compliant shell scripts.  This is a simple
collection of shell functions to simplify the implementation of user-friendly
command-line utilities.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/bazelbuild/sandboxfs/">sandboxfs</a></strong>: A virtual file
system for sandboxing.  This file system exposes an arbitrary view of the
host&rsquo;s file system under the mount point, allowing the fast creation of
directory trees to back sandboxes and containers.  Written in Go and owned by
the Bazel project.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/jmmv/sourcachefs/">sourcachefs</a></strong>: Persistent, read-only,
FUSE-based caching file system.  This file system offers a mechanism to cache
the contents of remote file systems transparently.  Note that this was my
first real Go program and hasn&rsquo;t received a lot of maintenance since its
publication so it may not be in the greatest style, but I wanted to publish it
anyway.  See <a href="/2016/02/sshfs-performance-analysis-for-builds.html">Analysis of SSHFS performance for large builds</a> for the motivation
behind this project.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/jmmv/sysbuild/">sysbuild</a></strong> and
<strong><a href="http://github.com/jmmv/sysupgrade/">sysupgrade</a></strong>: A couple of utilities to
build NetBSD from source and to upgrade a running NetBSD system.  I hate
executing procedures that involve more than one step by hand, so <em>I have to</em>
automate them.  These two tools are just two of many examples.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/tmpfs/">tmpfs</a></strong>: An efficient
memory file-system, originally for NetBSD (2005) and later ported to FreeBSD
(2008).  This was a project developed under the Google Summer of Code 2005
program.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://xmlcatmgr.sourceforge.net">XML Catalog Manager (xmlcatmgr)</a></strong>: A
small utility manipulate SGML and XML catalogs.  Designed to be integrated
into packaging systems as a lightweight dependency.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="contributions-to-existing-projects">Contributions to existing projects</h1>

<p>I have also contributed significantly to the following projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://bazel.build/">Bazel</a></strong>: A fast and correct build system, originated
at Google.  I started working on this project as <a href="/2016/01/joining-blaze-team.html">my main work assignment on
January 2016</a> and currently
focus on making this work on macOS as well as it does on Linux.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://colloquy.info/">Colloquy</a></strong>: An IRC client for Mac OS X.  Back when
I decided to fully switch to this operating system for my desktop machine, I
was connecting to NetBSD&rsquo;s chat network, which uses the ICB protocol.  In
order to have a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; OS X experience, I added ICB support to Colloquy and
along the way learned the basics of Objective C and Xcode.</li></p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a></strong>: General-purpose Unix-like, free, open
source operating system with a focus on performance and usability.  I have
been a committer since 2013.  My work has focused on the implementation of
<a href="http://julipedia.meroh.net/2013/12/introducing-freebsd-test-suite.html">The FreeBSD Test
Suite</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a></strong>: Desktop environment for Unix-like systems.
I originally ported Gnome 2.x to the NetBSD operating system and was the sole
maintainer of the resulting packages for a few years.  As a result of this, I
contributed countless patches upstream to address portability issues.</p></li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a></strong>: General-purpose Unix-like, free, open
source operating system with a focus on correct design and portability.  I
have been a committer since 2002 and served as a board member for two years.
Most of my work has been on <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>, the NetBSD&rsquo;s
packaging system, but I have also laid the foundations of the NetBSD test
suite and have developed the tmpfs file system.</p></li>
