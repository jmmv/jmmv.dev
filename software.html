<h1 id="authored-projects">Authored projects</h1>
<p>These are the <em>open source</em> projects I have initiated throughout the years. Dates indicate project creation time, and this list is sorted in reverse chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jmmv/endbasic/">EndBASIC</a> (2020):</strong> A BASIC language interpreter inspired by Amstrad&rsquo;s Locomotive BASIC 1.1 and Microsoft&rsquo;s QuickBASIC 4.5. Like the former, EndBASIC intends to provide an interactive environment that seamlessly merges coding with immediate visual feedback. Like the latter, EndBASIC offers higher-level programming constructs and strong typing. The main idea behind EndBASIC is to provide a playground for learning the foundations of programming in a simplified environment. Written in Rust and originally developed during the COVID-19 confinement. Runs on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS), Windows, and even <strong><a href="https://jmmv.github.io/endbasic/">on the web</a></strong>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/sandboxfs/">sandboxfs</a> (2017):</strong> A virtual FUSE file system for sandboxing. This file system exposes an arbitrary view of the host&rsquo;s file system under the mount point, allowing the fast creation of directory trees to back sandboxes and containers. Written in Rust and Go, and owned by the Bazel project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jmmv/sourcachefs/">sourcachefs</a> (2017):</strong> Persistent, read-only, FUSE-based caching file system. This file system offers a mechanism to cache the contents of remote file systems transparently. Note that this was my first real Go program and hasn&rsquo;t received a lot of maintenance since its publication so it may not be in the greatest style, but I wanted to publish it anyway. See <a href="/2016/02/sshfs-performance-analysis-for-builds.html">Analysis of SSHFS performance for large builds</a> for the motivation behind this project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jmmv/pkg_comp/">pkg_comp</a> (2017) and <a href="http://github.com/jmmv/sandboxctl/">sandboxctl</a> (2016):</strong> A couple of utilities to automatically build pkgsrc binary packages from source in a chroot-based sandbox. pkg_comp orchestrates the build using the pbulk build system and sandboxctl implements the management of the chroot-based sandbox on a bunch of different operating systems. Written in shell using shtk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jmmv/nudgytimer/">Nudgy Timer</a> (2015):</strong> Time tracker for Android that subtly pokes you every few minutes to help you figure out where your precious time is going to. Written in Java.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jmmv/markdown2social/">Markdown2Social</a> (2015):</strong> Converts Markdown articles to Google+ posts. Written in Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jmmv/shtk/">Shell Toolkit (shtk)</a> (2012):</strong> Application toolkit for programmers writing POSIX-compliant shell scripts. This is a simple collection of shell functions to simplify the implementation of user-friendly command-line utilities. Also provides a unit-testing framework for shell scripts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jmmv/sysbuild/">sysbuild</a> and <a href="http://github.com/jmmv/sysupgrade/">sysupgrade</a> (2012):</strong> A couple of utilities to build NetBSD from source and to upgrade a running NetBSD system. I dislike manually executing procedures that involve more than one step so <em>I have to</em> automate them. These two tools are just two of many examples. Written in shell using shtk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jmmv/lutok/">Lutok</a> (2011):</strong> A lightweight C++ API frontend to the Lua programming language. Lutok provides thin C++ wrappers around the Lua C API and makes extensive use of RAII to prevent resource leaks, exposes C++-friendly native data types, and reports errors via C++ exceptions. Originally developed as part of Kyua but split into its own project due to popular demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jmmv/kyua/">Kyua</a> (2010):</strong> A testing framework for infrastructure software. Kyua is used, primarily, by FreeBSD to run its operating system-wide test suite. Written in C++.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.netbsd.org/~jmmv/etcutils/">etcutils</a> (2010):</strong> Standalone utilities to manipulate some of the configuration files in <code>/etc</code> in a programmatic manner. Designed to be integrated into packaging systems as a lightweight dependency. Written in shell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/jmmv/atf/">Automated Testing Framework</a> (2007):</strong> Originally a tool to run tests in an automated manner (superseded by Kyua), ATF is now a collection of libraries to assist in writing tests in C, C++, and shell. Developed under the Google Summer of Code 2007 program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.highscore.de/boost/process/">Boost.Process</a> (2006):</strong> A flexible library for the C++ programming language to execute programs and manage their corresponding processes. This was a project developed under the Google Summer of Code 2006 program and was later picked up by another developer who maintains it to this day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/tmpfs/">tmpfs</a> (2005):</strong> An efficient memory file-system, originally for NetBSD (2005) and later ported to FreeBSD (2008). This was a project developed under the Google Summer of Code 2005 program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://vcsme.sourceforge.net/">VCS Made Easy</a> (2004)</strong>: An attempt to abstract common operations on a version control system behind a common user interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://menu2wm.sourceforge.net/">Menu2WM</a> (2003)</strong>: A tool to convert an XML specification of an applications menu into the native formats accepted by a variety of window managers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://xmlcatmgr.sourceforge.net">XML Catalog Manager (xmlcatmgr)</a> (2003):</strong> A small utility manipulate SGML and XML catalogs. Designed to be integrated into packaging systems as a lightweight dependency and still in use by pkgsrc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="contributions-to-existing-projects">Contributions to existing projects</h1>
<p>I have also contributed significantly to the following <em>open source</em> projects. Notably, any work made for hire that&rsquo;s not open source is not listed here; for that, see my <a href="/resume.html">resume</a>. Dates indicate the period of most activity and this list is sorted in reverse chronological order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> (2016&ndash;2020):</strong> A fast and correct build system, originated at Google. I started working on this project as <a href="/2016/01/joining-blaze-team.html">my main work assignment on January 2016</a> and have focused on making this work on macOS as well as it does on Linux, and also on its <a href="/2019/12/bazel-dynamic-execution-introduction.html">dynamic execution feature</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> (2013&ndash;2014):</strong> General-purpose Unix-like, free, open source operating system with a focus on performance and usability. I have been a committer since 2013. My work has focused on the implementation of <a href="/2013/12/introducing-freebsd-test-suite.html">The FreeBSD Test Suite</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.monotone.ca/">Monotone</a> (2007):</strong> A distributed version control system. This is the specific system that switched me over from CVS and Subversion to the distributed model. Git didn&rsquo;t exist yet. I contributed a few fixes, but mostly focused on rewriting the command-line&rsquo;s <a href="/2007/05/monotones-help-rewrite-merged.html">builtin help system</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://colloquy.info/">Colloquy</a> (2007):</strong> An IRC client for Mac OS X. Back when I decided to fully switch to this operating system for my desktop machine, I was connecting to NetBSD&rsquo;s chat network, which uses the ICB protocol. In order to have a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; OS X experience, I <a href="/2007/02/icb-support-added-to-colloquy.html">added ICB support</a> to Colloquy and along the way learned the basics of Objective C and Xcode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> (2004&ndash;2007):</strong> Desktop environment for Unix-like systems. I originally ported Gnome 2.x to the NetBSD operating system and was the sole maintainer of the packages for a few years. As a result of this, I contributed countless patches upstream to address portability issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> (2002&ndash;2012):</strong> General-purpose Unix-like, free, open source operating system with a focus on correct design and portability. I have been a committer since 2002 and served as a board member for two years. Most of my work has been on <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>, the NetBSD&rsquo;s packaging system, but I have also laid the foundations of the NetBSD test suite, have developed the tmpfs file system, and <a href="/2007/03/making-netbsd-multiboot-compatible.html">added Multiboot support</a> to the kernel.</p>
