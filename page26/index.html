        This week started easy:Added integration tests for the about and help subcommands. These were pretty easy to do.Added integration tests for the list subcommand. I initially added these tests as expected failures to reason about the appearance and behavior of this command from the point of view of the user before actually working on the code... and I am still writing such code to make these tests pass!This is where things got a bit awry. Polishing the behavior of the list command so that its interface is consistent among all flag and argument combinations is tricky and non-trivial. I ended up having to change code deep down in the source tree to implement missing features and to change existing bits and pieces:Implemented support to print all test case properties, not only the user-specific ones. The properties recognized by the runtime engine are stored as individual arguments of a structure, so these required some externalization code.Implemented "test case filtering". This allows users to select what tests to run on the command line at the test case granularity. For example, foo/bar selects all tests in a subdirectory if bar is a directory, or all the tests in the bar test program if it is a binary. But what is new (read: not found in ATF) is that you can even do foo/bar:test-1 where test-1 is the name of a test case within the foo/bar test program. I've been silently wishing for this feature to be available in ATF because it shortens the build/test/edit cycle, but it was not easy to add.Changed the internal representation of test suites to ensure all test program names are relative to the root of the test suite. The root of the test suite is considered to be the directory in which the top-level Kyuafile lives (/usr/tests/ in NetBSD). The whole point of doing this is to provide some consistency to the filters when the user decides to execute tests that are not in the current directory. For example, the following are now equivalent:$ cd /usr/tests &amp;&amp; kyua list fs/tmpfs$ kyua list -k /usr/tests/Kyuafile fs/tmpfsThe plans for the upcoming week are to finish with the clean up of the list command (which involves adding proper error reporting, refactoring of the command module and addition of unit tests) and start cleaning up the test command.Also, remember that BSDCan 2011 is now around the corner and that I will be talking about ATF, Kyua and NetBSD in it! &nbsp;My plan was to have a kyua-cli-0.1 release by the time of the conference, although this will be tricky to achieve...

        Few things worth mentioning this week as reviewing Summer of Code student applications has taken priority. The good thing is that there are several strong applications for NetBSD; the bad thing is that none relate directly to testing. Anyway, the work this week:Added a pkg-config file for atf-sh as well as an Autoconf macro to detect its presence. This is needed by Kyua to easily find atf-sh. (Yes, I know: this is an abuse of pkg-config, but it works pretty well and is consistent with atf-c and atf-c++.)Implemented basic integration tests for Kyua in r98&nbsp;using atf-sh. These tests are still very simple but provide a placeholder into which new tests will be plugged. Having good integration test coverage is key in preparation for a 0.1 release. Oh, and by the way, this revision has bumped the number of tests to 601, crossing the 600 barrier :-)That's pretty much it. Now, back to attempting to fix my home server as a fresh installation of NetBSD/macppc has decided to not boot any more. &nbsp;(Yes, this has blocked most of my weekend...)

        This week's work has been quite active on the ATF front but not so much in the Kyua one. I keep being incredibly busy on the weekends (read: traveling!) so it's hard to get any serious development work done.What has happened?Finally tracked down and fixed some random atf-run crashes that had been hunting the NetBSD test suite for months (see PR bin/44176). The fix is in reality an ugly workaround for the fact that a work directory cannot be considered "stable" even after the test case terminates. There may be dying processes around that touch the work directory contents, and the cleanup code in atf-run was not coping well with those. As it turns out, this problem also exists in Kyua (even though it's not as pronounced because arbitrary failures when running a test case do not crash the runtime engine) so I filed issue 17 to address it.Released ATF 0.13 and imported it both to NetBSD-current and pkgsrc. As a side note, Kyua requires the new features in this release, so putting it out there is a requirement to release Kyua 0.1. This new release does not have a big effect on NetBSD though, because the copy of ATF in NetBSD has been constantly receiving cherry-picks of the upstream fixes.Replaced several TODO items in the Kyua code with proper calls to the logging subsystem. These TODO items were referring to conditions in the code that should not happen, but for which we cannot do any proper recovery (like errors in a destructor). Sure, these could be better signaled as an assertion... but these code paths can be triggered in extremely-tricky conditions and having Kyua crash because of them is not nice (particularly when the side-effects of executing that code paths are non-critical).So, in retrospect, I have fulfilled the goal set past week of releasing ATF 0.13, but I haven't got to the addition of integration tests. Oh well... let's see if this upcoming week provides more spare time.

        This has been a slow week. In the previous report, I set the goal of&nbsp;getting Kyua to run the NetBSD test suite accurately (i.e. to report the same results as atf-run), and this has been accomplished. Actually, the changes required in Kyua to make this happen were minimal, but I got side-tracked fixing issues in NetBSD itself (both in the test suite and in the kernel!). So, the things done:Fixed Kyua to correctly kill any dangling subprocesses of a test case and thus match the behavior of atf-run. This was the only change required to make issue 16 happen: i.e. to get Kyua to report the same results as atf-run for the NetBSD test suite.Based on a suggestion from Antti Kantee, an alternative way to handle this would be to not kill any processes and just report the test case as broken if it fails to clean itself up. The rationale being that the runtime engine can kill dangling subprocesses in 99% of the occasions, but not always. The exception are those subprocesses that change their process group. It'd be better to make all cleanups explicit instead of hiding this corner case, as it can lead to confusion. Addressing this will have to wait though, as it is a pretty invasive change.Before closing issue 16, I want to implement some integration tests for Kyua to ensure that the whole system behaves as we expect (which is what the NetBSD test suite is currently doing implicitly).Kyua is pickier than atf-run: if a cleanup routine of a test case fails or crashes, Kyua will (correctly) report the test case as broken while atf-run will silently ignore this situation. Some NetBSD tests had crashing cleanup parts, so I fixed them.Some test programs in NetBSD were leaving unkilled subprocesses behind. These subprocesses are daemons and thus fall out of the scope of what Kyua can detect and kill during the cleanup phase. I mistakenly tracked down the problem to rump, but Antti Kantee kindly found the real problem in the kernel (not in rump!).As a side effect of processes being left behind, I extended the functionality of pidfile(3) and implemented pid file support in bozohttpd. &nbsp;This is to make the tests that spawn a bozohttpd in the background more robust, by giving them a way to forcibly kill the server during cleanup.These changes are still under review and not committed yet.For the upcoming week, I plan to add some basic integration tests to Kyua and release ATF 0.13. I've been running a NetBSD system with the latest ATF code integrated for a while (because Kyua requires it) and things have been working well.

        These days, I find myself talking about Kyua to "many" people.  In particular, whenever a new feature request for ATF comes in, I promise the requester that the feature will be addressed as part of Kyua.  However, I can imagine that this behavior leaves the requester with mixed feelings: it is nice that the feature will be implemented but, at the same time, it is very hard to know when because the web site of Kyua does not provide many details about its current status.In an attempt to give Kyua some more visibility, I will start posting weekly activity reports in this blog.  These reports will also include any work done on the ATF front, as the two projects are highly related at this point.  I write these reports regularly at work and I feel like it is a pretty good habit: every week, you have to spend some time thinking about what you did for the project and you feel guilty if the list of tasks is ~zero ;-)  It also, as I said, gives more visibility to the work being done so that outsiders know that the project is not being ignored.Before starting with what has happened this week, a bit of context.  I have been traveling like crazy and hosting guests over for the last 2 months.  This has given me virtually no time to work on Kyua but, finally, I have got a chance to do some work this past week.So, what are the news?Implemented the --loglevel command line flag, which closes issue 14.  Kyua now generates run-time logs of its internal activity to aid in postmortem debugging and this flag allows the user to control the verbosity of such logs.Antti Kantee hacked support for atf-run in the NetBSD source tree to dump a stack trace of any crashing test program.  I have backported this code to the upstream ATF code and filed issue 15 to implement this same functionality in Kyua.Fixed a hang in atf-run that made it get stuck when a test case spawned a child processes and atf-run failed to terminate it.  A quick test seems to indicate that Kyua is affected by a similar problem: it does not get stuck but it does not correctly kill the subprocesses.  The problem will be addressed as part of issue 16.Oh, and by the way: Kyua will be presented at BSDCan 2011.My plans for this week are to make Kyua run the full NetBSD test suite without regressions when compared to ATF.  Basically, the results of a test run with Kyua should be exactly the same as those of a test run with ATF.  No dangling processes should be left behind.Lastly, if you are interested in these reports and other Kyua news, you can subscribe to the kyua label feed and, if you want to stay up to date with any changes performed to the code, subscribe to the kyua-log mailing list.

        After about two months, I finally finished reading Twitterville by Shel Israel (@shelisrael).  One of my followers (@drio) asked for a review of the book, so here is my attempt to do so.But first, a quick summary: Twitterville is a book that focuses on the dynamics of Twitter.  It starts by explaining how Twitter works, but that is only a tiny introductory part of the book.  The majority of the contents explain how people and business interact with each other by means of Twitter, and it does so by providing lots of real-life stories.  The stories range from topics as diverse as businesses offering deals, to individuals raising funds for specific causes.The book is easy to read and is well structured, and as you read through it you will realize that the author had to do some major research efforts to collect all the stories that he presents.  I personally enjoyed the first half of the book a lot, but at some point I ran out of time for reading and my interest dropped.  It was hard to pick on reading again because the book becomes quite repetitive after a few chapters; just keep in mind that it is a collection of personal experiences organized by different major topics and you won't be disappointed.Twitterville has changed my view on Twitter.  I have discovered many "use cases" for Twitter that I could not imagine and, as many people do, I used to disregard Twitter as a useless "status updates" system.  Today, however, I have set up several Twitter searches to monitor some topics of my interest and I engage with people that I did not know beforehand.  It kinda feels like a world-wide unorganized chat room to me... but, as the author mentions many times, the way you see and use Twitter is up to you and you alone!

        The C++ interface to Lua implemented in Kyua exposes a lua::state class that wraps the lower-level lua_State* type. This class completely hides the internal C type of Lua to ensure that all calls that affect the state go through the lua::state class.Things get a bit messy when we want to inject native functions into the Lua environment. These functions follow the prototype represented by the lua_CFunction type:typedef int (*lua_CFunction)(lua_State*);Now, let's consider this code:intawesome_native_function(lua_State* state){    // Uh, we have access to s, so we bypass the lua::state!    ... do something nasty ...    // Oh, and we can throw an exception here...    //with bad consequences.}voidsetup(...){    lua::state state;    state.push_c_function(awesome_native_function);    state.set_global("myfunc");    ... run some script ...}The fact that we must pass a lua_CFunction prototype to the lua_pushcfunction object means that such function must have access to the raw lua_State* pointer... which we want to avoid.What we really want is the caller code to define a function such as:typedef int (*cxx_function)(lua::state&)In an ideal world, the lua::state class would implement a push_cxx_function that took a cxx_function, generated a thin C wrapper and injected such generated wrapper into Lua.  Unfortunately, we are not in an ideal world: C++ does not have high-order functions and thus the "generate a wrapper function" part of the previous proposal does not really work.What we can do instead, though, is to make the creation of C wrappers for these C++ functions trivial. And this is what r42 did.  The approach I took is similar to this overly-simplified (and broken) example:template&lt; cxx_function Function &gt;intwrap_cxx_function(lua_State* state){    try {        lua::state state_wrapper(state);        return Function(state_wrapper);    } catch (...) {        luaL_error(state, "Geez, don't go into C's land!");    }}This template wrapper takes a cxx_function object and generates a corresponding C function at compile time. This wrapper function ensures that C++ state does not propagate into the C world, as that often has catastrophical consequences. (Due to language limitations, the input function must have external linkage.  So no, it cannot be static.)As a result, we can rewrite our original snippet as:intawesome_native_function(lua::state& state){    // See, we cannot access lua_State* now.    ... do something ...    throw std::runtime_error("And we can even do this!");}voidsetup(...){    lua::state state;    state.push_c_function(        wrap_cxx_function);    state.set_global("myfunc");    ... run some script ...}Neat? I think so, but maybe not so much. I'm pretty sure there are cooler ways of achieving the above purpose in a cleaner way, but this one works nicely and has few overhead.
