This could be said to be a property of functional programming—never mind that it&rsquo;s used in compiler optimization a damn lot—so it may sound a bit out of scope in a readability post. Not really.</p><p>When you <em>force yourself to avoid modifying already-defined variables</em>, you will need to find other ways to express your intent. To do so, in general: you will use a high-order construction instead of a loop; you will end up having to define intermediate variables, each with its own descriptive name; or you will move pieces of the code to an auxiliary function, also with a descriptive name.</p></p><p class=text-muted>July 25, 2013

In this article we will focus on the former kind.</p><p>One way to think of those conditionals is as if they were to represent functions, just written inline.

For example:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>if</span> <span class=n>balance</span> <span class=o>&gt;=</span> <span class=mi>0</span><span class=p>:</span>

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>    <span class=n>color</span> <span class=o>=</span> <span class=n>RED</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this little code snippet, the condition <code>balance >= 0</code> only depends on one variable, and the two branches of the conditional cover all possible values of the input variable. I.e. the first branch covers all cases where the balance is positive or zero, and the second branch covers all cases where the balance is negative. The balance variable cannot have a value not covered by these cases. Easy.</p></p><p class=text-muted>July 18, 2013

No: a dictionary is not a way to implement abstract data types; doing so is lazy programming and is asking for trouble later on.</p><p>What do I mean by this? In Python and other similar dynamic languages, dictionaries are a mapping of keys to values that have no typing restrictions: the dictionary is heterogeneous, and a single dictionary can contain elements of different types both as its keys and its values. To make things worse, the syntax of the language makes it incredibly easy to create and populate dictionaries (unlike, say, in C++). Combine these two facts together and the temptation to abuse a dictionary to implement a structured data type is high.</p></p><p class=text-muted>July 4, 2013

Except that the real goal is to have <em>valuable</em> comments <em>only</em>, and doing so is a (very) complex matter. The code should document itself at all times, and be crystal-clear at doing so.

The previous post titled <a href=/2013/06/self-interview-after-leaving-netbsd.html>Self-interview after leaving the NetBSD board</a> has turned out to be, by far, the most popular article in this blog.

All of us have, at some point, written <code>calc_usage</code> instead of <code>calculate_usage</code>; <code>res</code> instead of <code>result</code>; <code>stmt</code> instead of <code>statement</code>; <code>ctx</code> instead of <code>context</code>; etc. The thought goes &ldquo;<em>well, these abbreviations are obvious, and I&rsquo;ll be a much faster developer!</em>&rdquo;</p><p>Wrong. You might think you are faster at typing, but you don&rsquo;t write code in one go and never ever get back to it again. As we have already mentioned, code is usually only written once and is later read many times, possibly by people other than the original developer. At the very least, I&rsquo;d expect you going over your code <em>once</em> before checking it into your repository.
