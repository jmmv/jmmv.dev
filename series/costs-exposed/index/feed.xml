&lt;p>The idea I&amp;rsquo;m trying to convey is hard to communicate in the abstract so, in that post, I used the differences between a monorepo and a multirepo setup as an example. Today, I&amp;rsquo;ll expore a different scenario to support the same idea. I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about how certain ticket assignment practices during on-call operations can expose service support costs vs. how other practices hide them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that, just like in the previous post, I do not want to compare the general merits of one approach vs. the other. The &lt;em>only&lt;/em> thing I want to compare is whether one approach centralizes toil and allows management to quantify its cost vs. how another approach hides toil by smearing it over the whole team in hard-to-quantify ways. Whether management &lt;em>actually does something&lt;/em> to correct the situation once the costs are exposed is a different story.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-08-26-tickets-phone.jpg" length="539252" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Costs exposed: Monorepo vs. multirepo</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/costs-exposed-monorepo-multirepo.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 06:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/costs-exposed-monorepo-multirepo.html</guid><description>&lt;p>In software engineering organizations, there are certain practices that keep costs under control even if those &lt;em>seem&lt;/em> more expensive at first. Unfortunately, because such practices &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> more expensive, teams choose to keep their status quo even when they know it is suboptimal. This choice ends up hurting productivity and morale because planned work is continuously interrupted, which in turn drags project completion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason I say &lt;em>seem&lt;/em> and not &lt;em>are&lt;/em> is because the alternatives to these cost-exposing practices also suffer from costs. The difference is that, while the former surface costs, leading to the need to allocate time and people to infrastructure work, the latter keeps the costs smeared over teams and individuals in ways that are difficult to account and plan for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To illustrate what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say, I&amp;rsquo;ll present three different scenarios in which this opinion applies. All of these case studies come from past personal experiences while working in different teams and projects. The first one covered in this post is about the adoption of a monorepo vs. the use of multiple different repositories. The other two will come in follow-up articles.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-08-23-freebsd-gnome-repos.png" length="162711" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
