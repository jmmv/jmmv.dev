Unfortunately, because such practices &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> more expensive, teams choose to keep their status quo even when they know it is suboptimal. This choice ends up hurting productivity and morale because planned work is continuously interrupted, which in turn drags project completion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason I say &lt;em>seem&lt;/em> and not &lt;em>are&lt;/em> is because the alternatives to these cost-exposing practices also suffer from costs. The difference is that, while the former surface costs, leading to the need to allocate time and people to infrastructure work, the latter keeps the costs smeared over teams and individuals in ways that are difficult to account and plan for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To illustrate what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say, I&amp;rsquo;ll present three different scenarios in which this opinion applies. All of these case studies come from past personal experiences while working in different teams and projects. The first one covered in this post is about the adoption of a monorepo vs. the use of multiple different repositories. The other two will come in follow-up articles.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-08-23-freebsd-gnome-repos.png" length="162711" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
