That, however, does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> mean that it is &lt;em>opaque&lt;/em>. In fact, it feels quite the opposite in many areas, which might be a surprise to you&amp;mdash;especially if you develop on/for open-source operating systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Networked file systems</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-networked-fs.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-networked-fs.html</guid><description>&lt;p>I briefly mentioned in the &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html">intro to this series&lt;/a> that, as part of the transition to Windows, I recently built my most powerful home server ever. The server in question is a machine from 2011 so it&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;powerful&amp;rdquo;, but it&amp;rsquo;s the best I have ever had as a home server! And it is running FreeBSD 13.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wait, wait, wait. What does this have to do with Windows?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: PowerShell</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-powershell.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 07:20:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-powershell.html</guid><description>&lt;p>The native Windows command line, the one derived from DOS, is objectively painful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the one hand, the batch language is &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050909-24/?p=34263">full of hacks&lt;/a> that have cropped up over the years. These hacks exist to offer new features while maintaining strict backwards compatibility, a heroic effort with nasty consequences. On the other hand, the interactive editing features of &lt;code>cmd.exe&lt;/code> are rudimentary&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, PowerShell exists as a first-party, built-into-Windows alternative to &lt;code>cmd.exe&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Development experience</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-devel.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-devel.html</guid><description>&lt;p>We are finally entering the final part of this one-year retrospective by shifting gears into developer-oriented topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hadn&amp;rsquo;t touched Windows to write code since 2006 and the development experience has massively changed for the better during the last 6 years. So let&amp;rsquo;s start this part by talking about the crown jewel of development on modern Windows: the WSL + Windows Terminal + VSCode trifecta.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Miscellaneous tools</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-tools.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-tools.html</guid><description>&lt;p>The previous episode in this series was about PowerToys: a nice collection of first-party tools to extend the functionality of Windows for power users. But what about functionality that&amp;rsquo;s built into the system? There are a few more areas I wanted to touch on before concluding the GUI part of these series, so let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: PowerToys</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-powertoys.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-powertoys.html</guid><description>&lt;p>If you were around the Windows 95 days, you may remember the PowerToys addon. PowerToys &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerToys#PowerToys_for_Windows_95">was a collection&lt;/a> of first-party miscellaneous utilities targeted at power users and it died off sometime around 2010. In a surprising (to me) move on May 2019, Microsoft relaunched this brand as an &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys">open-source project&lt;/a> targeting modern versions of Windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time of this writing, PowerToys provides 12 different disparate tools. Which ones you find interesting will depend on your needs. As for me, here are my favorite picks after a year of experimentation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Window switching</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-alt-tab.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-alt-tab.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Windows is about managing windows so it should excel at window switching. Uh huh? Let&amp;rsquo;s investigate how that works in this episode and how Windows&amp;rsquo; approach feels to a long-time macOS user. Spoiler alert: I never really liked macOS&amp;rsquo;s way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Look'n'feel</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-gui.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-gui.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Enough complaining about keyboards, shortcuts, and input methods. Let&amp;rsquo;s shift this one-year reflection to the user interface and slowly towards more positive topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s make one thing clear: GUIs are like colors. There are plenty to choose from, everyone has their preferences, and that&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em>fine&lt;/em>. Windows&amp;rsquo; GUI is what it is and doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave a lot of room for customization. If you are a macOS user, you have learnt to put up with a similar approach, but if you are a Linux user, you will despair at the lack of options.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Input methods</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-input.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 09:45:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-input.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post on this series was almost a rant on how keyboard shortcuts &lt;del>don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/del> work on Windows. &lt;code>@blude&lt;/code> on Twitter was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blude/status/1501214824784666628?s=20&amp;amp;t=WvhNLIzGiWVy8rmznG54xA">curious to know about inserting &amp;ldquo;special characters&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, which is really an euphemism for non-English letters. As a non-native English speaker, inserting such letters is something I occasionally have to do but somehow the topic didn&amp;rsquo;t cross my mind. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Keyboard shortcuts</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-shortcuts.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-shortcuts.html</guid><description>&lt;p>As I mentioned in &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html">the introduction to these series&lt;/a>, different physical keyboards are a source of frustration. This, however, pales in comparison to trying to use Windows as a former macOS user: the different keyboard shortcuts break muscle memory, and this made me feel completely unproductive and&amp;hellip; furious every time I made a mistake.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Introduction</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><author>julio@meroh.net (Julio Merino)</author><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html</guid><description>&lt;ul>

&lt;p>A bit over a week ago, I narrated &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/my-story-with-windows.html">my decades-long love and hate relationship with Windows&lt;/a>. Today, it&amp;rsquo;s time to &lt;em>start&lt;/em> covering my impressions of this platform after spending a year on it as my primary OS. This is noteworthy because I had been a Unix-only person for about 25 years and spent the last 15 on macOS alone. Switching to Windows 10 and 11 has been quite a change and&amp;hellip; for the most part, a positive one. I like what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
