PowerToys was a collection of first-party miscellaneous utilities targeted at power users and it died off sometime around 2010. In a surprising (to me) move on May 2019, Microsoft relaunched this brand as an open-source project targeting modern versions of Windows.
At the time of this writing, PowerToys provides 12 different disparate tools. Which ones you find interesting will depend on your needs.</description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Window switching</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-alt-tab.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-alt-tab.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Windows is about managing windows so it should excel at window switching. Uh huh? Let&amp;rsquo;s investigate how that works in this episode and how Windows' approach feels to a long-time macOS user. Spoiler alert: I never really liked macOS&amp;rsquo;s way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Look'n'feel</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-gui.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-gui.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Enough complaining about keyboards, shortcuts, and input methods. Let&amp;rsquo;s shift this one-year reflection to the user interface and slowly towards more positive topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s make one thing clear: GUIs are like colors. There are plenty to choose from, everyone has their preferences, and that&amp;rsquo;s just &lt;em>fine&lt;/em>. Windows' GUI is what it is and doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave a lot of room for customization. If you are a macOS user, you have learnt to put up with a similar approach, but if you are a Linux user, you will despair at the lack of options.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Input methods</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-input.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 09:45:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-input.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post on this series was almost a rant on how keyboard shortcuts &lt;del>don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/del> work on Windows. &lt;code>@blude&lt;/code> on Twitter was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blude/status/1501214824784666628?s=20&amp;amp;t=WvhNLIzGiWVy8rmznG54xA">curious to know about inserting &amp;ldquo;special characters&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, which is really an euphemism for non-English letters. As a non-native English speaker, inserting such letters is something I occasionally have to do but somehow the topic didn&amp;rsquo;t cross my mind. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Keyboard shortcuts</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-shortcuts.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-shortcuts.html</guid><description>&lt;p>As I mentioned in &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html">the introduction to these series&lt;/a>, different physical keyboards are a source of frustration. This, however, pales in comparison to trying to use Windows as a former macOS user: the different keyboard shortcuts break muscle memory, and this made me feel completely unproductive and&amp;hellip; furious every time I made a mistake.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year on Windows: Introduction</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 06:30:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html</guid><description>&lt;p>A bit over a week ago, I narrated &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/my-story-with-windows.html">my decades-long love and hate relationship with Windows&lt;/a>. Today, it&amp;rsquo;s time to &lt;em>start&lt;/em> covering my impressions of this platform after spending a year on it as my primary OS. This is noteworthy because I had been a Unix-only person for about 25 years and spent the last 15 on macOS alone. Switching to Windows 10 and 11 has been quite a change and&amp;hellip; for the most part, a positive one. I like what I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
