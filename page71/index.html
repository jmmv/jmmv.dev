      <p>
        A while ago, somebody called John asked me to explain the process I follow when I update the GNOME packages in pkgsrc.  As I'll be doing this again in a few days (to bring 2.12.2 into the tree), this seems a good moment for the essay.  Here I go:The first thing I do is to fetch the whole distribution from the FTP site; i.e., the platform and desktop directories located under the latest stable version.  I have a little script that does this for me, avoiding to fetch the distfiles that haven't changed since the previous version.Once this is done I generate a list of all the downloaded distfiles and adjust the package dependencies in meta-pkgs/gnome-devel/Makefile, meta-pkgs/gnome-base/Makefile and meta-pkgs/gnome/Makefile to require the new versions; this includes adding any possible new stuff.  I do this manually, which is a quite boring task; however, writing a script could take much more time.Afterward, I use cvs diff -u meta-pkgs/gnome* | grep '^+' over the modified files to get a list of the packages that need to be updated.  As the list of dependencies in the meta-packages is sorted in reverse order &mdash; i.e., a package in the n-th position uses packages in the 1..n-1 positions but not any in the n+1..N ones &mdash; this command creates a useful "step by step" guide of what needs to be done.Then, it is a matter of updating all the packages that need it, which is, by far, the longest part of the process.  I go one by one, bumping their version, building them, installing the results, ensuring the PLIST is correct, and generating a log file in the same directory that will serve me during the commit part.  I also have a little script that automates most of this stuff for a given package &mdash; and, thanks to verifypc, this is relatively quick :-)In the last part described, there are some packages that always scare me due to the portability problems that plague them over and over again.  These include the ones that try to access the hardware to get information, to control multimedia peripherals, to manage network stuff, etc.  I don't know why some packages break in similar places in newer versions even if the mainstream developers have been sent some patches to fix the stuff in previous versions.  &lt;/rant&gt;Once I've got the updated gnome-base package installed, I zap all my GNOME configuration &mdash; ~/.gconf*, ~/.nautilus*, ~/.metacity*, ~/.gnome* and a lot more garbage &mdash; and try to start it.  At this point, it is mostly useless, but I can see if there are serious problems in any of the most basic libraries.  If so, this is the time to go for some bug hunting!When the gnome-base package works, I continue to update all the other missing packages and try to package the new ones, if any.  Adding new stuff is not easy in general (portability bugs again) and this is why some of the dependencies are still commented out in the meta-packages.  Anyway, with this done, I finally start the complete desktop and check if there are any major problems with the most "important" applications.  Again, if there are any, it is a good time to solve them.So all the updates are done, but nobody guarantees that they work, specially because I do all the work under NetBSD-current.  So I generally (but not always... shame on me!) use pkg_comp to check that they work, at the very least, under the latest stable release (3.0 at this point).The last part is to commit all the stuff in a short time window to minimize pain to end users.  Even though I have left log files all around and prepared the correct entries for the CHANGES file, this often takes more than an hour.Unfortunately, end users always suffer, either because the packages break on their platform, because our packaging updating tools suck or simply because I made some mistake (e.g., forgot to commit something).  But this is what pkgsrc-current is for, isn't it?  ;-)And, of course, another thing to do is to review all the newly added local patches, clean them up, adapt them to the development versions of their corresponding packages and submit them to GNOME's bugzilla.  This is gratifying, but also a big, big pain.Well, well... this has been quite long, but I think I haven't left anything out.

      <p>
        Yesterday's evening, I was organizing some of my pictures when I noticed that Nautilus wasn't generating previews for any of them.  This annoyed me so much that I decided to track down the issue, which I've done today.The first thing I did was to attach a gdb session to the currently running Nautilus process, adding some breakpoints to the functions that seemed to generate preview images; I located them using grep(1) and some obvious keywords.  This wasn't very helpful, but at least I could see that the thumbnail generation routine checks whether the file is local or not (because Nautilus lets you set different preferences for them).With this in mind, I resorted to the traditional and not-so-elegant printf debugging technique (which, with pkgsrc in the middle, is quite annoying).  Effectively, a call to gnome_vfs_uri_is_local was always returning false, no matter which file it was passed.  It was clear that the problem was in gnome-vfs itself.So I switched to the gnome-vfs code, located that function and saw that it was very short: basically, all it does is delegate its task to another function that depends on the method associated to the file &mdash; you can think of the method as the protocol that manages it.  As I was accessing local files, the method in use was the file method (implemented in modules/file-method.c), so the affected function was, how not, its do_is_local.As it is a bit complex (due to caching issues for efficiency), I added some more printfs to it to isolate a bit more the problem, which drove me to the filesystem_type function implemented in modules/fstype.c.  And man, when looking at this function I quickly understood why it was the focus of the problem.  It is so clumsy &mdash; portability-wise &mdash; that it is very easy for it to break under untested circumstances: it is composed of a set of mutually exclusive ifdefs (one for each possible situation) to determine the file system name in which a file lives.And you guessed right: NetBSD 3.x didn't match any of them, so it resorted to a default entry (returning an unknown file system type) that is always treated as remote by the file method code.The solution has been to workaround the detection of one of these special cases in the configure script to properly detect statvfs(2) under NetBSD.  This is just a hack that adds to the uglyness of the original code, but fixing this issue properly will require a lot of work and the willingness of the gnome-vfs maintainers to accept the changes.I will ask for a pull-up to the pkgsrc-2005Q4 branch when I've been able to confirm that this does not break on other NetBSD versions.  Now have fun watching your images again! ;-)

        As a present for my saint (I don't know if this is the proper expression in English) &mdash; which I celebrate today due to my second name (Manuel) &mdash; I got a BenQ FP202W flat panel.  It's a 20" wide screen, providing a 16:10 aspect ration at its native resolution of 1680x1050 pixels.  This contrasts heavily with my now-old Viewsonic E70f, a 17" CRT doing only 1024x768@85Hz.And man, this new monitor is truly amazing.  Maximizing windows is a thing of the past!  (Except for the media player, of course ;)  Being able to have two documents open side by side is great: for example, you can keep your editor in one side while reading a reference manual in the other side without having to constantly switch between windows; and even then, there is still room for other things.  Moreover, playing Half-Life 2 in widescreen mode is... great :)I've also tried to plug it to the iBook G4; it works fine for most things but feels a bit sluggish when some effects come into the game (aka, Exposé or Dashboard).  Looks like its video card is not powerful enough to handle it flawlessy (something I can understand).  I ought to try its clamshell mode, though, as disabling its builtin screen may make it faster; but first I need to get a USB keyboard...Concluding: while the old CRT monitor was still in perfect working condition, the switch has been great.  I don't know why I hesitated to do it ;)  If you have the money to buy such a display, I certainly recommend it.Happy new year 2006!

        In the OS world, each OS comes with its custom boot loader that knows how to load the kernel and how to pass the execution flow to it.  These boot loaders often know very little about other OSes, so if you need a multi-OS environment, you have to install several different boot loaders.  It is often tricky to get them to coexist and, even if you accomplish it, it's still annoying to chainload between them.The GRUB developers wrote the Multiboot specification which aims to solve this problem.  This specification defines an interface between a boot loader and the OS's kernel, so that any Multiboot-compliant boot loader can execute any Multiboot-compliant OS without knowing any of its internal details.  There are several free OSes that already follow this specification, including GNU/Hurd, ForthOS, AtheOS or Syllable.  (I'm sure there are many more.)Although this is i386-specific, I think the idea is quite interesting.  Therefore, I've started adapting the NetBSD kernel to this specification.  I'm progressing (very) slowly, mostly because the lack of documentation on boot code, the complexity behind it and some bugs in GRUB!  No matter what, I can boot a kernel directly from GRUB already, although it still lacks configuration (i.e., information about the boot device, memory mappings, etc.).  Leave me some more days and I think it'll be ready :-)What are those bugs in GRUB I said?  The specification reserves some space in the Multiboot header to specify where in memory the image has to be loaded.  This is required for a.out binaries but it is optional for ELF binaries... and optional means that GRUB forgets about it in the ELF case.  Which is a pity because I must pass special information through there.  To the curious ones, the kernel's text is mapped into the 0xc0100000 virtual address, but the boot loader must load it into the physical address 0x00100000 (because paging is not enabled and such high addresses are not available).  Similarly for all the other segments.I also hope to write a little boot(9) manual page as a result of this mini-project, explaining the overall NetBSD boot process (at least under i386).  I'm sure many people could benefit from it.Edit (23:49): Some typos and grammar incorrections pointed out by Amitai Schlair have been fixed.

        Merry Christmas, my fellow readers, and thanks for reading this blog!  Seizing the opportunity to post some numbers: since this blog was moved from Livejournal to Blogger it has got around 2.300 unique visits.  This makes the 209th post and the blog has been up for 19 months; I think it's in good health.Oh, and I just got a Linksys WRT54GS broadband router as a Christmas present...  time to set it up :-)

        The last weekend of past November, Monotone's main author, Graydon Hoare, proposed a "bugathon": a time frame in which all efforts could be focused on fixing existing bugs in the code.  The price for solving a bug was a T-Shirt (or any other object from its CafePress shop), so I decided to help a bit by fixing some portability bugs to NetBSD.  And today, I received the long sleeved T-Shirt I ordered in exchange for the fixes :-)  (Will post a photo of this one too when I learn how to do it.)

        The NetBSD Project has just released a new major version of its operating system, thus making NetBSD 3.0.  This release comes a year after of 2.0 publication and includes lots of new features and bug fixes.  For more information, see the announcement (also available in Spanish).From here, a big thank you to all the people who made this release possible and, specially, to the release engineering team.
