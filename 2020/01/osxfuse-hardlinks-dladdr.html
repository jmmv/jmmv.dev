</code></pre><p>The interesting pieces of this error message are:</p><ul><li>the cause of the failure: <code>(Segmentation fault): sandbox-exec failed: error executing command</code>, and</li><li>the binary that triggered it: <code>external/remotejdk11_macos/bin/java</code>.</li></ul><p>Wait, what? <strong>The JVM crashed?</strong> And there are no core dumps under <code>/cores</code> even when I have <code>startup --unlimit_coredumps</code> in my <code>~/.bazelrc</code>? Yikes.</p><h1 id=initial-debugging-steps>Initial debugging steps</h1><p>Debugging sandboxfs-related problems is <a href=https://jmmv.dev/2017/10/fighting-execs-sandboxfs-macos.html>always &ldquo;fun&rdquo;</a>. We start with a crash of an arbitrary program and we have to figure out how sandboxfs, or who knows what else in the macOS black box, might have caused it. Combined with the lack of sources for many of the pieces involved and the parallelism introduced by Bazel, we face an interesting reverse-engineering process.</p><p>The first step in troubleshooting any sandboxing-related failure, be it with sandboxfs or not, is to pass <code>--sandbox_debug</code> to the Bazel invocation. By default, Bazel deletes the sandbox directories immediately after executing an action and also unmounts the sandboxfs instance when the build finishes. When we pass the debugging flag, however, Bazel leaves all files and the sandboxfs instance behind so we can navigate into the directory (<code>/private/var/tmp/_bazel_jmmv/0db9681485d75d94d76b2f9336cd9468/sandbox/sandboxfs/2</code> from the logs above) and run the failing command by hand (everything after <code>exec</code>&mdash;but not including <code>exec</code> itself to avoid exiting the shell).</p><p>But, surprise! Passing <code>--sandbox_debug</code> makes this specific problem disappear and allows the build to complete. Wait, what again?</p><p>My first thought was that my recent changes to the reconfiguration protocol in sandboxfs were at fault. Maybe the unmap operations of an action were affecting the sandbox of another action, making files disappear from under them. But this was easy to rule out: running with a previous sandboxfs release didn&rsquo;t make a difference.</p><p>Then I thought that we might have a race between the sandbox destruction and the JVM process staying behind (e.g. due to workers)&mldr; but that theory did not hold either. Disabling workers made no difference, which makes sense because they are not sandboxed by default anyway&mldr;</p><p>Thinking more about the problem, the only logical conclusion was that a preceding action was at fault, and that its effects were causing the JVM to fail later. To confirm this, I ran the build with <code>--jobs=1</code>, waited until it failed, and then ran it again a few times. And, sure enough, for each incremental build, Bazel was only able to run two Java actions: the first successfully and the second crashing.</p><p>Alright. So now we know that we have two Java actions running consecutively, and whatever the former does impacts the behavior of the latter. This is only true when <code>--sandbox_debug</code> is <strong>not</strong> enabled, which means the problem has to come from the deletion of the first sandbox.</p><p>Maybe the second sandbox had paths pointing into the first sandbox? Unlikely, but that kind of dependency would explain the problem. Here is where I instrumented (<em>cough</em> added <code>printf</code>s <em>cough</em>) Bazel to show the reconfiguration requests sent to sandboxfs. And, of course, the second sandbox had no references to the first sandbox. How could they possibly interfere with each other then?</p><h1 id=a-performance-optimization-in-sandboxfs>A performance optimization in sandboxfs</h1><p>Let&rsquo;s take a detour from debugging.</p><p>An important thing to know here is that sandboxfs comes with a performance optimization that avoids having to re-read the same toolchains from disk on each action.</p><p>The way this works is the following: when a file is mapped at two different locations within the sandboxfs mount point, sandboxfs preserves the same inode number for the two instances of the file&mdash;hereby simulating hard links. This is done for the duration of the sandboxfs instance, even if a file goes through various map and unmap operations.</p><p>In our particular case, the whole JVM is mapped into each action&rsquo;s subdirectory. If we look into the sandboxfs instance with <code>ls -i</code>, we see something like this:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>25 .../sandboxfs/1/external/remotejdk11_macos/bin/java
51 .../sandboxfs/1/external/remotejdk11_macos/lib/libjava.dylib
[...]
25 .../sandboxfs/2/external/remotejdk11_macos/bin/java
51 .../sandboxfs/2/external/remotejdk11_macos/lib/libjava.dylib
</code></pre><p>where 25 and 51 are the inode numbers assigned to those files. Note how the sandbox instance changes (<code>sandboxfs/1/</code> vs. <code>sandboxfs/2/</code>) but the inode numbers are the same.</p><p>And this is the only kind of sharing that happens across the sandboxes. Is it at fault? It probably is. What if I disabled it?</p><p>I patched the sandboxfs source code to never reuse inodes, and lo and behold, the problem disappeared.</p><p>But why? As far as I can tell, this feature had never been a problem. In fact, Bazel could build itself on top of sandboxfs not long ago. What has changed?</p><h1 id=narrowing-the-problem-down>Narrowing the problem down</h1><p>Let&rsquo;s get back to debugging.</p><p>Up to this point, we know that sandboxfs&rsquo; inode sharing is causing problems&mdash;so we know how to workaround the problem. But why is this a problem? We still have zero information on why this might be causing the JVM to crash.</p><p>To continue our debugging session, I ran <code>dtruss</code> over the failing binary:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>[...]

Is the bug inside the <code>dyld</code> dynamic loader then? That was my working theory for a while, so I went to <a href=https://opensource.apple.com/>Apple&rsquo;s Open Source portal</a> to find the <code>dyld</code> sources&mldr; but unfortunately they are not available for Catalina. Regardless, I started with the sources from Mojave and found the calls to <code>sysctl</code> shown above, so I was probably in the right location.

If the process had been easier, I&rsquo;d have rebuilt the JVM with debugging symbols and traced through the debugger&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not easy, so I was left with visual code inspection, which led to nowhere. So then I thought that maybe I could dig further with <code>lldb</code>.</p><p>And indeed I could. I spent a bit of time figuring out <code>lldb</code>&rsquo;s capabilities, and found that I could disassemble the whole function, dump registers, and print memory positions<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. It wasn&rsquo;t trivial to make sense of the data because I had to read about x86-64 calling conventions (never had to use them before) and figure out the right incarnation of commands to get to the details I needed. But eventually I got them. I got to the <code>os::dll_address_to_library_name</code> function, which calls into the system&rsquo;s <code>dlattr(3)</code>, and which was returning an invalid path: for the JVM executed from <code>.../sandboxfs/2</code>, the <code>dlinfo.dli_fname</code> field contained a path into <code>.../sandboxfs/1</code>. What the hell.</p><p>We can now explain the crash: we get a path to a file that doesn&rsquo;t exist any longer (because the preceding action&rsquo;s sandbox was cleared) and this code is not prepared to deal with such error condition. Boom. But still, why?</p><h1 id=minimal-reproduction-steps>Minimal reproduction steps</h1><p>At this point I knew where the problem was, but any attempts at further debugging were made annoying by the indirections introduced by Bazel during execution and by the JVM&rsquo;s complex code.</p><p>I wanted a minimal reproduction scenario so I wrote a little program that loads a dynamic library from the current directory, which then calls into <code>dlattr</code> to find its own address. With that, I could map the binary and the library at two locations using sandboxfs and see if the problem arose.</p><p>Here is the minimal reproduction case:</p><ol><li><p>Fetch and install a sandboxfs release from <a href=https://github.com/bazelbuild/sandboxfs>https://github.com/bazelbuild/sandboxfs</a>.</p></li><li><p>Create <code>addr.c</code>:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-c data-lang=c><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=cp>#include</span> <span class=cpf>&lt;dlfcn.h&gt;</span><span class=cp>

I also tried to expose this set up via <a href=https://bindfs.org/>bindfs</a>, but it turns out that bindfs doesn&rsquo;t expose the underlying hardlinks as such&mldr; so no luck in ruling out FUSE.</p><p>Yet, the only conclusion is that the kernel is tracking this information. And because the problem doesn&rsquo;t show up with APFS, it most likely is the OSXFUSE kext&rsquo;s fault.</p><h1 id=root-cause>Root cause</h1><p>Time to dig into OSXFUSE&rsquo;s kext code&mldr; but having little experience with that, it&rsquo;d have been a time sink for me. Having spent over a day on this, I couldn&rsquo;t justify spending more time on this bug.</p><p>So I sent an email to a coworker that has a lot more experience with this code base and has offered to help with further issues in the past. A day later, I got a very helpful reply. Quoting his diagnosis:</p><blockquote><p>So, the true parameter to the <code>open</code> call in the OSXFUSE kext is a vnode struct (transparent to all kernel code). The kernel finds the relevant vnode struct as a preprocessing step when you do an <code>open()</code> call with a path from userland. In the base case, it finds the vnode by issuing <code>vnop_lookup</code> to the relevant file system for each path component down the path, and fuse ultimately creates the vnode struct for <code>a.out</code>, with its <code>v_parent</code> member pointing to the vnode for the <code>a</code> directory.</p><p>When you then cd to <code>b</code> and run <code>./a.out</code>, the loader in userland does a relative <code>open("a.out")</code> as part of bootstrapping the spawned process, before <code>main()</code> runs. The vnode that it finds for this call is the same one as in the first run, with the <code>a</code> dir as its <code>v_parent</code>. I am pretty sure that is due to the vnode cache within the OSXFUSE kext (<code>fuse_node.c/fuse_nodehash.c</code>) ignoring the path and blindly using the inode number. Your <code>dladdr()</code> call then does <code>fcntl(fd, F_GETPATH)</code> on that fd that was opened that way, and that joins the strings by following the vnode chain.</p><p>Now, the real FS doesn&rsquo;t seem to support dir hard links. In what is probably the closest APFS analogy to your use case, you would have a file that&rsquo;s a hard link to another, and <code>open()</code> both. APFS appears to replace the <code>v_name</code> on the same vnode object when the 2nd path is looked up, which is not a bulletproof strategy either. If you open both paths on APFS and keep them open, an <code>F_GETPATH</code> on either one will return the path from the later open.</p></blockquote><p>Sad face. There is no easy fix because of the latter paragraph: if we use the same identity and keep the vnode open from two locations at once, they will report ambiguous results no matter what.</p><p>The recommendation I got from this coworker is to get rid of the inode reuse in sandboxfs and instead try to track the file equivalence in some other way. He suggests that the performance penalty won&rsquo;t be large&mdash;and that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ll have to measure. For now, I guess I&rsquo;ll implement a flag in sandboxfs to make inode reuse configurable and turn it off by default. Better have slower-but-reliable builds than failing builds.</p><p>The last remaining question is why this has become a problem just now. Has something changed in Catalina? Is Bazel doing something slightly different than before in how it maps the JVM inside the sandbox to tickle this bug? I don&rsquo;t know. Further thoughts welcome.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this story!</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>This process brought me back to about 20 (?) years ago when I was at our summer house, sitting in front of an old portable 386 with nothing else to do.
