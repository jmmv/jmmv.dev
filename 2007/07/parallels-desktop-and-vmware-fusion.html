<meta property="og:title" content="Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion - Julio Merino (jmmv.dev)"><meta property="twitter:title" content="Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion - Julio Merino (jmmv.dev)"><meta name=description content="Back in February, I bought a copy of Parallels Desktop 2 and have been a very happy user of it since then. However, when Parallels 3 appeared, I hesitated to pre-order it (even at a very low price) and I did well: after it was released, I tried it on my MacBook Pro and their 3D support is useless for me. I could not play neither Half-Life 2 nor Doom 3 at acceptable speeds, being the former much worse than the latter in this regard.
Now, I'm evaluating VMware Fusion RC1, and I'm almost convinced to pre-order it. This product is very similar to Parallels and in fact several of its features seem &#34;inspired&#34; on it, such as Unity (Coherence in Parallels speak). But it has some important features that Parallels cannot currently match. To know: support for 64-bit guests, support for 2 virtual CPUs in guests and support to network-boot the virtual machine. All of these are cool from a development point of view. The first two allow one to run some more versions of specific operating systems, such as NetBSD/amd64, as well as enabling SMP support in them. The last one makes it easy to boot development kernels without modifying any virtual disk (haven't tried this yet, though).
All is not good though. Fusion is also supposed to have experimental 3D support inside the guest machines (up to DirectX 8.1). However, when trying to launch Half-Life 2 inside a Windows XP SP2 virtual machine, Windows crashed with a BSOD. At least I could launch it in Parallels, albeit it was simply unplayable. But as none of the two products make for a good gaming experience, I personally don't care about this feature.
Let's conclude with some numbers about the speed of each product. I installed Debian GNU/Linux leeny under Parallels and Fusion and built monotone-0.35 from scratch under them. The virtual machines were configured to have 768MB of RAM of a total of 2GB and the machine was idle aside from the build jobs. Obviously, in the case of Parallels I could only run the test with the i386 port, but in Fusion I used both the i386 and amd64 ports with 1 and 2 virtual CPUs. I also ran the same tests on the native machine using Mac OS X 10.4.10. The timings only include the make command, not ./configure.
