I&rsquo;ve been drive-testing it for a few months and have been quite pleased with it, so here go my impressions.</p><h1 id=how-did-i-get-here>How did I get here?</h1><p>Let&rsquo;s backtrack a bit first. I&rsquo;ve been a Vim and Emacs user for many years. Yes, I use both <em>regularly</em> depending on what I have to achieve. For me, Vim shines in doing quick single-file changes and repetitive edits through many files, while Emacs shines in long-lived coding sessions that involve numerous open buffers. These editors are well-suited to <a href=/2015/09/my-coding-workflow.html>my remote-based coding workflow</a> because they run just fine in the terminal. However, sometimes I just <em>would like to</em> take advantage of the desktop environment and the GUI of these two editors on OS X&mldr; err.. sucks&mldr; so I&rsquo;ve been wanting to find something else.</p><p>As a result, with all the hype around GitHub&rsquo;s <a href=http://atom.io/>Atom</a> last year, I decided to jump on the bandwagon and gave it a try. My first encounters with Atom were not great: I found the environment bloated&mdash;just look at the endless settings and extensions panel&mdash;and clunky: the UI seemed convoluted, and Atom would routinely spit internal errors when performing &ldquo;usual&rdquo; editing tasks. Granted, these were probably caused by the extensions I had installed&mldr; but I don&rsquo;t think I installed anything out of the ordinary!</p><p>No matter what, I carried on and used Atom to write the first version of this site. The experience didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;hook me&rdquo; so I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to use Atom for anything else. But, soon after, VSCode entered the scene with a similar premise to Atom, and in fact built on the same platform. You may or may not like Microsoft, but they are pretty damn good at building IDEs&mldr; ergo VSCode deserved a try.</p><h1 id=enter-vscode>Enter VSCode</h1><p>VSCode&rsquo;s interface is pretty barebones. There is nothing particularly shiny about the editor when you open it the first time: a sidebar with four spartan sections and an empty content panel to display files. If you dare to launch the settings editor, you are met with two editing panels: one on the left to display the default settings in JSON format, and one on the right with an empty file waiting for your overrides. Uh huh?</p><p>That&rsquo;s right. At first sight, VSCode can give the impression of being a joke&mdash;I certainly thought so when I encountered the, literally, settings editor&mdash;, but that&rsquo;s very far from the truth.</p><p>Start using the <strong>command palette</strong> to navigate files and commands; it&rsquo;s like Emacs&rsquo; <code>M-x</code>, but magical. Notice how non-intrusive but powerful the <strong>Git integration</strong> is&mdash;and I heard that it may be even better than Atom&rsquo;s, which would be ironic&mldr; Navigate the editor with <strong>reasonable keyboard bindings</strong>, just as you would expect. Appreciate the utter <strong>simplicity of the configuration mechanism</strong>. And, the icing, install <strong>extensions</strong>: as I understand it, VSCode&rsquo;s initial target was to support web-based languages, but production-quality extensions now exist for native languages&mdash;including C#, C++, and Go.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve personally come to enjoy using VSCode. Part of this is because the editor made me so much more productive writing code in a new language, Go. As I hinted <a href=/2016/03/golang-review.html#a-note-on-visual-studio-code>in a previous post</a>, having <strong>semantic auto-completion</strong>, <strong>assisted code navigation</strong>, and <strong>automated code reformatting plus validation</strong> are invaluable features when navigating a new, unknown language. I&rsquo;d have certainly written Go code in Emacs (and that&rsquo;s exactly how I started), but it&rsquo;d have been a much more painful experience.</p><p>There are also teeny tiny touches that help everyday tasks. One example is the preview of colors when entering color codes in CSS: the editor displays a little box next to the code filled with the color you provided. Another example is how hovering on CSS properties or JSON configuration properties pops up a bubble with more information about the symbol underneath and all possible values.</p><h2 id=open-source-project>Open source project</h2><p>Can Microsoft deliver an open source project without strange licenses and with development happening in the open? It indeed seems so, which is an 180-degree turn from what the company did a few years ago.</p><p>VSCode is an open source project in all regards: the code is released under the very liberal MIT license (but <a href=http://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/supporting/faq#_licensing>see these FAQs</a>), the project is <a href=http://github.com/microsoft/vscode>hosted on GitHub</a>, and Microsoft has been able to create a community around the editor. Make no mistake: VSCode is not a code dump. (I&rsquo;ve personally filed a few feature requests with them and, even though my requests were rejected, the rationales they provided were convincing and the timeliness of the responses was much appreciated.)</p><h2 id=workspaces>Workspaces</h2><p>Back to the settings chatter, one particular detail I have come to like is the ability to trivially define and customize workspaces (aka projects): create a <code>.vscode/settings.json</code> file at the top of your tree with any project-specific configuration overrides (e.g. indentation tweaks) and VSCode will apply those transparently. I appreciate the fact that this has to be done explicitly and that the contents of the file are super-simple and human readable. Contrast this to, say, Android Studio, which creates an <code>.idea</code> directory with almost-unreadable contents.</p><p>With the right command-line alias, all you have to do is type <code>code .</code> at the top-level directory of your project to launch a new instance of VSCode ready to work on your project&mdash;and the editor remembers where you left off last time. In case you are curious, an alias for OS X would be:</p><pre><code>alias code=&quot;open -a 'Visual Studio Code'&quot;
</code></pre><h2 id=some-bad-parts>Some bad parts</h2><p>So what about the bad? I don&rsquo;t have much to complain about, really.</p><p>Obviously, the fact that VSCode is a graphical editor means that it is not usable on the terminal, which is a blocker for doing remote work. Similarly, VSCode currently only supports Windows, OS X, and Linux; I don&rsquo;t think there is any technical blocking the support of other systems, but the port needs to be done and is probably not super-easy.</p><p>Lastly, while the authors praise VSCode&rsquo;s small size, I don&rsquo;t really buy it: the fact that the editor is based on <a href=http://electron.atom.io/>Electron</a>, weights several megabytes, and takes a few seconds to start counters this. But, really, none of these have bothered me.</p><h1 id=parting-words>Parting words</h1><p>If for any reason you would like to try a different editor, I&rsquo;d certainly encourage you to give VSCode a chance. Make sure to go over the <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics>editor basics document</a> to familiarize yourself with the environment and delve into the more advanced topics later on.</p><p>I, for one, will continue to use Vim and Emacs for a lot of my work, but VSCode has gained a spot for certain types of projects. How this split will balance in one direction or the other, only time will tell: there are things I like and dislike in both camps. But remember: it&rsquo;s all about choosing the right tool for the job, so restricting yourself to just one editor is most likely counterproductive.</p><p>If you let me&mldr; I&rsquo;ll conclude by saying that Atom is to Emacs what VSCode is to Vim. &ldquo;<em>What do you mean by this?</em>&rdquo; you say? Ah, I don&rsquo;t know, you&rsquo;ll have to figure it out yourself!</p></article></div></div><div class="container post-links"><div class=row><div class="col mr-auto text-left"><span><a href=https://jmmv.dev/2016/03/golang-review.html>&#171; Previous</a></span></div><div class="col text-center"><span><a href=/archive.html>All posts</a></span></div><div class="col ml-auto text-right"><span><a href=https://jmmv.dev/2016/05/homepage-v3.html>Next &#187;</a></span></div></div></div><div class="container post-votes"><div class=row><div class="col-lg-4 my-2"><div class=row><div class=col><a onclick=voteThumbsUp() class="btn btn-block btn-outline-success" id=thumbs-up-btn>👍
