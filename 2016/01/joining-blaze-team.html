      <article>
        <p>It has been <a href="https://medium.com/@jmmv/six-years-at-google-8b06563fab08">over 6 years since I joined
Google</a> and
throughout this time I have been in the Storage SRE family: first with GFS,
then with Colossus, and last with Persistent Disk.  Even though this counts as
3 different teams, the reality is that I have been doing mostly the same type
of work all around.</p>

<p>I had pondered the idea of switching to a pure Software Engineer (SWE) role for
all these years and never taken any action.  Until now.  Things change, and the
time has come for me to make a move and pursue that thought in an effort to
grow in a different direction.  And why now, you ask?  Well, simply because I
have found a role in the NYC office for a project that I am personally
passionate about.</p>

<!--end-of-excerpt-->

<h1 id="the-new-team">The new team</h1>

<p>So, without further ado, <strong>today is my first day in the Blaze development
team</strong>.  The specific details of what I’ll be doing is something I cannot share
here, if only because they are still blurry to me!</p>

<p>What I can say, though, is that Blaze was released as open source in March of
2015 under the <a href="http://bazel.io/">Bazel</a> project.  Around that time, I wrote an
article titled <a href="/2015/04/on-bazel-and-open-source.html">On Bazel and Open
Source</a> which
introduced Bazel and then went on to describe some of the shortcomings that
would prevent wide adoption in the open source world if those issues went
infixed</p>

<p>That article was seen as unnecessarily negative by some. So, as I like to think
about it: the time has come for me to put my efforts where my mouth and
interests are.  I don’t know if I’ll have the time to address the issues I
described in that article about Bazel, but I surely hope to have a chance to
contribute to the open source project.</p>

<h1 id="writing-java">Writing Java</h1>

<p>As you may know, Blaze/Bazel are Java.  Some of my peers have made fun of this
fact, but you know what?  Modern Java is quite nice and enjoyable to write with
a proper IDE, so I’m looking forward to that.</p>

<p>I have recently come to this conclusion while working on the <a href="/2015/12/introducing-nudgytimer.html">Nudgy Timer
Android app</a> I announced a month
ago.  I had not coded in Java for 7 years and I started doing so again for this
app, resulting in a pretty nice experience.  (Not because Android Studio, which
I’d rant about… but because of Java itself and IntelliJ’s coding aids.)</p>

<h1 id="looking-back">Looking back</h1>

<p>I don’t leave my previous SRE position without realizing that I have learned a
damn lot over these 6 years in this role.  You know, when I joined Google I
wondered why I ended up in SRE because my expertise “didn’t line up well” (ha,
ha, now I know it did in fact).  I have also had friends routinely ask if I got
a lot of training at Google, to which my answer always was “no, not really”.
But the truth is that the training has happened and now I know much more about
running a production system than I ever thought I would.</p>

<p>And because of this, I want this same stealthy process to improve my software
development skills.  It’s true that I have been working as a software engineer
in a multitude of distributed open source project like NetBSD, but being an
enthusiast is one thing and developing professionally for a project whose
developers sit in the same cube as oneself is a very different one—and I
have never done the latter yet.</p>

<p>Exciting times lie ahead.</p>
