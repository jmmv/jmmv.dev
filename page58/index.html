        A bit more than three years ago, I renewed my main machine and bought an Athlon XP 2600+ with 512MB of RAM and a 80GB hard disk.  The speed boost I noticed in games, builds and the overall system usage was incredible &mdash; I was coming from a Pentium II 233 with 384MB of RAM.With the change, I was finally able to switch from plain window managers to desktop environments (alternating KDE and GNOME from time to time) and still keep a usable machine.  I was also able to play the games of that era at high resolutions.  And, what benefited me more, the build times of packages and NetBSD itself were cut by more than a half.  For example, it previously needed between 6 to 7 hours to do a full NetBSD release build and, after the switch, it barely took 2.  On the pkgsrc side, building some packages was almost instantaneous because the machine processed both the infrastructure and the source builds like crazy.But time passes and nowadays the machine feels extremely sluggish.  And you know that hardware does not degrade like this so it's easy to conclude it's software's fault.  (Thank God I've done some upgrades on the hardware, like doubling the memory, replacing the video card and adding a faster hard disk.)I'm currently running Kubuntu 6.10 and KDE is desperately slow in some situations; of course GNOME has its critical scenarios too.  (Well... it is not that slow, but responsiveness is, and that makes a big amount of the final experience.)  The problem is they behaved much better in the past yet I, as a desktop user, haven't noticed any great usability improvement that is worth such speed differences.  As a side note: I know the developers of both projects try their best to optimize the code &mdash; kudos to them! &mdash; but this is how I see it in my machine.Another data point, this time more objective than the previous one.  Remember I mentioned NetBSD took less than 2 hours to build?  Guess what.  It now takes 5 to 6 hours to build a full release; it's as if I went back in time 3 years!  Or take pkgsrc: the infrastructure is now very, very slow; in some packages, it takes more time than the program's build itself.I could continue this rant but... it'd drive nowhere.  Please do not take it as something against NetBSD, pkgsrc and KDE in particular.  I've taken these three projects to illustrate the issue because they are the ones I can compare to the software I used when I bought the machine.  I'm sure all other software suffers from slowdowns.Anyway, three years seem to be too much for a machine.  Sometimes I think developers should be banned fast machines because, usually, they are the ones with the fastest machines.  This makes them not notice the slowdowns as much as end users do.  Kind of joking.

        Old hard disks exposed a lot of their internals to the operating system: in order to request a data block from the drive, the system had to specify the exact cylinder, head and sector (CHS) where it was located (as happens with floppy disks).  This structure became unsustainable as drives got larger (due to some limits in the BIOS calls) and more intelligent.Current hard disks are little (and complex) specific-purpose machines that work in LBA mode (not CHS).  Oversimplifying, when presented a sector number and an operation, they read or write the corresponding block wherever it physically is &mdash; i.e. the operating system needn't care any more about the physical location of that sector in the disk.  (They do provide CHS values to the BIOS, but they are fake and do not cover the whole disk size.)  This is very interesting because the drive can automatically remap a failing sector to a different position if needed, thus correcting some serious errors in a transparent fashion (more on this below).Furthermore, "new" disks also have a very interesting diagnostic feature known as S.M.A.R.T.  This interface keeps track of internal disk status information, which can be queried by the user, and also provides a way to ask the drive to run some self-tests.If you are wondering how I discovered this, it is because I recently had two hard disks fail (one in my desktop PC and the one in the iBook) reporting physical read errors.  I thought I had to replace them but using smartmontools and dd(1) I was able to resolve the problems.  Just try a smartctl -a /dev/disk0 on your system and be impressed by the amount of detailed information it prints!  (This should be harmless but I take no responsibility if it fails for you in some way.)First of all I started by running an exhaustive surface test on the drive by using the smartctl -t long /dev/disk0.  It is interesting to note that the test is performed by the drive itself, without interaction with the operating system; if you try it you will see that not even the hard disk led blinks, which means that the test does not "emit" any data through the ATA bus.  Anyway.  The test ended prematurely due to the read errors and reported the first failing sector; this can be seen by using smartctl -l selftest /dev/disk0.With the failing sector at hand (which was also reported in dmesg when it was first encountered by the operating system), I wrote some data over it with dd(1) hoping that the drive could remap it to a new place.  This should have worked according to the instructions at smartmontools' web site, but it didn't.  The sector kept failing and the disk kept reporting that it still had some sectors pending to be remapped (the Reallocated_Sector_Ct attribute).  (I now think this was because I didn't use a big-enough block size to do the write, so at some point dd(1) tried to read some data and failed.)After a lot of testing, I decided to wipe out the whole disk (also using dd(1)) hoping that at some point the writes could force the disk to remap a sector.  And it worked!  After a full pass S.M.A.R.T. reported that there were no more sectors to be remapped and that several ones were moved.  Let's now hope that no more bad sectors appear... but the desktop disk has been working fine since the "fixes" for over a month and has not developed any more problems.All in all a very handy tool for testing your computer health.  It is recommended that you read the full smartctl(1) manual page before trying it; it contains important information, specially if you are new to S.M.A.R.T. as I were.

        The implementation of an efficient memory-based file system (tmpfs) for NetBSD was my Google Summer of Code 2005 project. After the program was over, the code was committed to the repository and some other developers (specially YAMAMOTO Takashi) did several fixes and improvements in it.  However, several problems remained in it that prevented tagging it release quality (see this thread).Finally I found some time to deal with most of them, something that has kept me busy for around three weeks (and which I should have done much, much earlier). All the issues that were resolved are detailed in this other post.There still are some problems in the code (which code doesn't have any?) but these do not prevent tmpfs from working fine. Of course they should be addressed in the future but people is already enjoying tmpfs in their installations and have been requesting its activation by default for a long time.Hence, after core@'s blessing, I'm proud to announce that tmpfs has been marked non-experimental and is now enabled by default in the GENERIC kernels of amd64, i386, macppc and sparc64.  Other platforms will probably follow soon.The next logical step is to replace mfs with tmpfs wherever the former is used (e.g. in sysinst) but more testing is required before this happens.  And this is what 4.0_BETA will allow users to do :-)  Enjoy!

        vnd(4) is the virtual disk driver found in NetBSD. It provides a disk-like interface to files which allows you to treat them as if they were disks. This is useful, for example, when a file holds a file system image (e.g. the typical ISO-9660 files) and you want to inspect its contents.Up until now vnd(4) used the vnode's bmap and strategy operations to access the backing file. These operate at the block-level and therefore do not involve any system-wide caches; this is why they were used (see below).  Unfortunately, some file systems (e.g. tmpfs and smbfs) do not implement these operations so vnd could not work with files stored inside them.One of the possible fixes to resolve this problem was to make vnd(4) use the regular read and write operations; these act on a higher (byte) level and are so fundamental that must be implemented by all file systems.  The disadvantage is that all data that flows through these two methods ends up in the buffer cache.  (If I understand it correctly, this is problematic because vnd itself will also push a copy of the same data into the cache thus ending up with duplicates in there.)Despite that minor problem, I believe it is better to have vnd(4) working in all cases even if that involves some performance penalty in some situations (which can be fixed anyway by implementing the missing operations later on). So this is what I have done: vnd(4) will now use read and write for those files stored in file systems where bmap and strategy are not available and continue to use the latter two if they are present (as it has always done).Some more information can be found in the CVS commit and its corresponding bug report.

        I've just added a couple of project proposals related to improving Ext2/Ext3 file system support in the NetBSD Operating System.  These are:Implement Ext3 file system supportImprove support for Ext2 root filesystemIf you are interested in getting into file system development &mdash; a very interesting research area, believe me! ;-) &mdash; this is probably a safe bet.  These two projects are not very complex but can quickly benefit NetBSD for different reasons (not only better Linux compatibility).  Check out their descriptions for more details!

        Back in February this year I added Multiboot support to NetBSD/i386.  Unfortunately, the implemenation was quite hackish because it required the application of a patch to GRUB-Legacy: the code used the "a.out kludge" present in the Multiboot specification which this bootloader incorrectly omitted in ELF kernels; the patch fixed this issue. However, this prevented booting NetBSD with mainstream GRUB builds (those used by all Linux distributions), thus making this feature mostly useless.The need for the "a.out kludge" came from two different problems:The kernel's ELF image was incorrectly linked because it did not set the correct physical load addresses for the segments it contained, thus GRUB could not load it because it thought there was not enough memory.The "a.out kludge" was used here to tell the boot loader which was the correct address to load the binary image into. Pavel Cahyna fixed this issue back in May, removing the need for the hack in this specific case.The native boot loader constructs a minimal ELF image that contains the kernel symbol table (ksyms) and sticks it just after the BSS space in memory.  GRUB did not do this so the NetBSD kernel resorted to manually creating this image itself based on the data passed in by GRUB.  In order to be successful, some space was reserved after the BSS section by using the "a.out kludge" (tricking the bootloader to think that this section was larger than it actually was) so that the kernel's bootstrapping process could freely access it. Pavel's fix did not address this problem so, when booting a NetBSD Multiboot kernel with an unpatched GRUB, ksyms did not work.I've now finally fixed this long-standing issue appropriately. All the code to create the minimal ELF image is gone and instead the kernel simply moves the data passed in by GRUB to a memory region that is available after bootstrapping. Then, it uses a custom function (ksyms_init_explicit instead of ksyms_init) which does not need any ELF headers to initialize the ksyms.The results are much clearer and less error-prone code as well as the ability to boot NetBSD straight from a stock GRUB installation! Keep in mind that this will go into 4.0, so setting up dual-boot machines will be easier than ever :-)I've prepared a couple of screenshots for your pleasure.  First, a look at the configuration used to boot a Multiboot-enabled NetBSD kernel:And then a look at the messages printed by the kernel as well as a demonstration that ksyms work by invoking a backtrace in the debugger (ddb):

        I think I've already covered all the areas I had in mind about these two operating systems.  And as the thread has lasted for too long, I'm concluding it now.  Here is a summary of all items described:IntroductionHardware supportThe environmentSoftware installationAutomatic updatesFreedomCommercial softwareDevelopment platformAfter all these notes I still can't decide which operating system I'd prefer based on quality, features and cost. Nowadays I'm quite happy with Kubuntu (installed it to see how it works after breaking Ubuntu and it seems good so far) and I'll possibly stick to it for some more months.This will last until I feel the need to buy a Mac again (or simply renew my desktop), at which point I might buy one with Mac OS X or wait until the desire passes away ;-)
