        Yesterday night, we went to a techno club &mdash; Webster Hall &mdash; which had Carl Cox as an invited DJ. Some of my friends around here enjoy this music and said this was a great DJ, so we couldn't miss it. He indeed was good.Today, after few hours of sleep, I have been doing quite a bit of housework: basically, huge cleaning, reordering and some DIY &mdash; had to fix some drawers. Resolving the extremely loud and annoying hissing caused by the heating system will have to wait, though.What I have enjoyed today, though, is spending the evening walking around Brooklyn and, more specifically, in Prospect Park. Central Park is very nice, you know, but this other park is too! Not to mention that the borough (Brooklyn) seems awesome... or at least the few neighborhoods I've visited so far. Much more relaxed than Manhattan and, I've been told, cheaper for living. Anyway, enjoy the photos :-)I guess tomorrow will be, finally, a museum day. Not going out tonight (I'm extremely tired and can't meet my friends) so I guess I'll be able to wake up early and seize the day. We'll see.Note to self: never, never, never again, buy batteries from a crappy deli. They last for a few photos only! Who knows for how long they have been in the shop shelves.

        For some unknown reason, I'm regaining interest in Boost.Process lately.  I guess many of the people who have written me in the past asking for the status of the library will be happy to hear this, but I can't promise I will stick to coding it for long.  I have to say that I have received compliments from quite a few people...  thanks if you are reading and sorry if I did not reply you at all.Anyway.  So I downloaded my code and ran the unit tests under Mac OS X to make sure that everything still worked before attempting to do any further coding.  Oops, lots of failures!  All tests spawning a child process broke due to an EINTR received by waitpid(2).  That doesn't look good; it certainly didn't happen before.After these failures, I tried the same thing under Linux to make sure that the failures were not caused by some compatibility issue with Mac OS X.  Oops, failures again! Worrisome.  The curious thing is that the tests do work in Win32 &mdash; but that can be somewhat expected because all the internal code that does the real work is platform-specific.Curiously, though, running the examples (not the tests, but the sample little programs distributed as part of the library documentation) did not raise any errors. Hence, I tried to run gdb on the actual tests to see if the debugger could shed any light on the failures.  No way.  Debugging the unit tests this way is not easy because Boost.Test does a lot of bookkeeping itself &mdash; yeah, newer versions of the library have cool features for debugging, but they don't work on OS X.  Hmm, so what if I run gdb on the examples? Oh! The problem magically appears again.It has taken me a long while to figure out the problem. Along the process, I have gone through thoughts of memory corruption issues and race conditions. In the end, the response was much simpler: it all turns out to SIGCHLD (as the error code returned by waitpid(2) well said).SIGCHLD is received by a process whenever any of its children change status (e.g. terminates execution). The default behavior of the signal handler for SIGCHLD is to discard the signal. Therefore, when this signal is received, no system calls are aborted because it is effectively discarded. However, it turns out that newer versions of Boost.Test install signal handlers for a lot of signals (all?) to allow the test monitor to capture unmanaged signals and report them as errors. Similarly, gdb also installs a signal handler for SIGCHLD. As a result, Boost.Process does not work when run under gdb or Boost.Test because the blocking system calls in the library do not deal with EINTR, but it actually works for non-test programs run out of the debugger.The first solution I tried was to simply retry the waitpid(2) whenever an EINTR error was received. This fixes the problem when running the tests under gdb. Unfortunately, the test cases are signaled as failed anyway because the test monitor still receives SIGCHLD and considers it a failure.The second solution I have implemented consists on resetting the SIGCHLD handler to its default behavior when Boost.Process spawns a new child and restoring the old SIGCHLD handler when the last child managed by Boost.Process is awaited for.  Eventually, the library could do something useful with the signal, but discarding it seems to be good enough for now.This second solution is the one that is going to stay, probably, unless you have any other suggestion. I still feel it is a bit fragile, but can't think of anything better. For example: what if the user of Boost.Process had already programmed a handler for SIGCHLD? I just think that such a case shouldn't be considered because, after all, if you are using Boost.Process to manage children processes, you shouldn't have to deal with SIGCHLD on your own as long as the library provides a correct abstraction for it.

        Wow, I haven't blogged for a long time (a month since last post) and I'm already counting down my days in NYC... less than a month and a half left here :-( I certainly miss some things from home, such as the nice little (non-fancy) bars, my bike, the gym, a nice house and, of course, friends and family, but I'm not in a real hurry to go back.So what have been the recent happenings? There are lots of things to tell I guess.First of all, almost all interns are gone. Of all I knew, probably 15-20, only 2 are left, 3 if you count me. This probably means we'll have to look for new friends to grow our partying group a little bit.On another topic, I don't have roommates any more. The ones I had moved to a bigger place and I haven't yet found anyone who wants to share this apartment. The major problem is that the room to be rented is, actually, the living room, so it is hard to convince someone to live here. Lack of privacy is an issue for most even if they don't say so right away.As regards working out, I'm getting way too lazy. It has already been more than a week since I last went running. Will try to force myself to go tomorrow morning again; the food is already starting to accumulate in the wrong places. Somewhat related to this, I've got an iPod Nano 4th generation which, when put together the Nike+ kit, is amazing.And we have got a "new" addiction at work: Guitar Hero. This game is really nice and we are already playing it on the expert level. However, I wonder if it is any good to spend time learning how to play a fake guitar. I'd rather go and buy a real one, and instead spend my time playing real songs. Let's hope Guitar Rising keeps up with the expectations and is published soon; whenever that happens, I'll definitely get it.About more recent happenings, I've been in NYCBSDCon 2008 this weekend giving a presentation on ATF. We'll have the video recordings posted out soon, so be sure to check them to learn some interesting new stuff. It was also a good way to meet well-known people in the BSD world such as, for example, Matt Dillon and Dru Lavigne.As regards work at Google, my project is starting to have decent shape, which means that it actually works! During the next month, I'll have to extend it to some new areas, and that's a bit scary because they'll involve processing vast amounts of data in an efficient manner. (At the moment, the data set is not big enough to really require tuning the code.)Oh, and one last thing about mini-golf. I have played, I think, 4 times already and lost in all of them. This game sucks. Will keep trying, though.I'm missing lots of stuff here, but I don't know how to add more random notes and not end with a completely disconnected post. All the paragraphs are already too independent as they are now. So just wait for the next one to know more :P

        I just realized that today makes two months since I left my home in Barcelona and headed first to Italy and then to NYC. This means I only have two more months and a week to stay at Google. Ew, time flies so fast...But so far, things are going great. They could certainly be a little bit better, but not by much!Today, two friends from Spain just left my apartment. They had been here for 10 days doing tourism around the city and visiting lots of stuff. I wish I could also take some vacations like that.And tomorrow it's time for another race: Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. It is just 5Km in Central Park, so it will be pretty easy but, hopefully, fun enough. The only "problem" is that it is at 9am, and today is Saturday... so I need to hang go out (with some restrictions)!

        Wow, I realized yesterday that I have already been in NYC for a full month! That means that I only have three left before leaving... time flies :-(I also apologize (to those who have noted!) for not writing for the past week, but I have lost "interest".  All posts were starting to be similar to each other because there aren't that many new things to explain every day.  Or, put it another way: I now usually have better things to do in the evenings rather than blogging :-PAs regards work, I have spent the past two weeks trying to code something, but all my attempts were worthless. Yesterday, though, my manager and I found a trivial way to resolve the problem at hand. It is not the nicest solution, but does the trick for now. Ew, two weeks of "wasted" coding efforts! But, as he put it, these efforts have been a good way to introduce myself into big projects within Google.Now I have been assigned another coding task and it seems pretty darn cool to me. This is not related to my real project, though, but it should be possible to finish it in one week and will be useful to give me more exposure to other Google technologies. In special, MapReduce. Yeah, I can say that; after all, what MapReduce is is disclosed ;-)Before finishing, let me point out something else that has caught my attention here in the city. There are lots of places to get your nails done, and all the people in these places is visible from the street. Curious, at the very least.Oh! Be sure to listen to the "Gettysburg trilogy" (the three songs in the second disc) in The Glorious Burden album from Iced Earth. Have been quite addicted to it for the last days.

        Day 21 (August 8th): Some work at Google and went out later with a friend from work and the friends that are visiting from Barcelona. We went to a bar called Spice Market: quite fancy but also expensive and not that fun.Day 22 (August 9th): Stayed at home for most of the day, which was pretty nice because I had not done this since I left Barcelona four weeks ago. In the morning, I went to a barber though. At night, went out with my roommate and some of her friends to a party. This was also an excuse to celebrate my birthday, which happened today (in day 23rd, I mean).Day 23 (August 10th): Turned 24. Went shopping for a fast external hard disk and ended up buying a Lacie D2 Quadra 500GB. Did some tests using the FW800 connection and the results are quite impressive. I spent part of the evening at Google doing some personal work, then went running and then drank cava at home to "celebrate" my birthday.OK, and now that I remember, here is another thing that has caught my attention in NYC. There are a lot of places to cut your nails... and what's "interesting" is that, from the street, you can see all the people sitting there while they are being served.

        Another regular day at work, except that I have finally been assigned some coding work. Yay! Haven't coded for a rather long while, and I need to do something. Aside that, got some Google gear that I was supposed to get on the first day but didn't. This includes a water bottle, a towel, yet another t-shirt and a notebook.Somewhat related: I also ate way too much, which makes my stomach hurt and feel incredibly tired. Or maybe I am tired due to the run this evening, in which I pushed myself too hard. But I must run the Human Race (10Km) in less than 45 minutes! Yes, personal goal.
