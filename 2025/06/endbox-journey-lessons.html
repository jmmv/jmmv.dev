This design was inspired by NetBSD&rsquo;s wscons, and the text explains how so. After that, the article continues to show how to extend the redesigned interface to talk to an SPI-attached LCD, how the SPI communication works, and how double-buffering and damage tracking allow for fast rendering performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This is the article that started the EndBOX but I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time. You&rsquo;ll notice that the article ends with a list of parts to build your own embedded box&mldr; but because the software wasn&rsquo;t readily available as a downloadable SD card image, I haven&rsquo;t heard of anyone trying to use it at all.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lessons learned:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>SPI bus access:</em> I had to reverse-engineer the sample C code that came with the ST7735s LCD, figure out how to access the SPI bus from Rust, and re-implement parts of it in my own terms. I also had to learn about DTB overlays because the SPI bus is disabled by default. I did not have to dive deep into DTBs at this point, but that came to bite me later.</p></li><li><p><em>Rasterization algorithms:</em> Up until that point, EndBASIC had leveraged the SDL library and HTML canvas elements for graphics rendering. But when writing directly to an LCD&mldr; the only thing you can do is poke pixels. So I had to read on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm>Bresenham&rsquo;s line algorithm</a> and the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_circle_algorithm>Midpoint circle algorithm</a>, implement them and, of course, find a way to write unit tests.</p></li></ul></li></ul><hr><p><strong><a href=/2024/12/netbsd-build-system.html>&ldquo;Revisiting the NetBSD build system&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>On December 28th, 2024</em></p><figure><img src=/images/2024-12-28-netbsd-tools.png></figure><ul><li><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The article presents a general overview of how the NetBSD build system shines in achieving cross-platform, cross-architecture, and root-less builds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relevance:</strong> I had to get back into NetBSD after many years of not touching it because its cross-building features were key to getting EndBOX up and running.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lessons learned:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Not much has changed:</em> This is more a realization than a lesson, but it was good to see that not much had changed since I used to use NetBSD on a daily basis. This is good because it shows how resilient BSD systems are, but also bad because some problems that made me leave NetBSD are still present.</p></li><li><p><em>NetBSD is still unique:</em> I don&rsquo;t know of any other OS that supports cross-building as trivially as NetBSD does, much less without requiring root access to generate disk images. I hear FreeBSD 15 will sport these same features, and that&rsquo;s exiting, but &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll believe them when I see them&rdquo;.</p></li></ul></li></ul><hr><p><strong><a href=/2025/01/make-help.html>&ldquo;Self-documenting Makefiles&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>On January 10th, 2025</em></p><figure><img src=/images/2025-01-10-make-help.png></figure><ul><li><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This article is a hands-on tutorial on how to write <code>Makefile</code>s that provide help messages by scanning their own content.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relevance:</strong> I had read about this idea before but had never put it to practice. In developing the EndBOX, I had to create a rather complex <code>Makefile</code> to glue together the patching of the NetBSD tree, the build of the NetBSD toolchain and release, the cross-compilation of EndBASIC for aarch64, and the bundling of all pieces together into a final disk image.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lessons learned:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Fragility:</em> Implementing this idea is simple, but in the discussions that followed the article publication, I realized at least two problems: trailing space in variable assignments in <code>make</code> is meaningful and this approach cannot easily work if you have includes in your <code>Makefile</code>s. Not a big deal for my use case, but having practiced this, I know when and when not do retry this in the future.</p></li><li><p><em>Use make and you&rsquo;ll have a bad time:</em> Nothing surprising here, but getting the <code>Makefile</code> to orchestrate all these disparate builds and to do it <em>correctly</em> without spurious rebuilds has been painful. What&rsquo;s worse is that the resulting build process takes a long time because <code>make</code> is unable to properly parallelize all build steps. It hurts to see my 72-core server &ldquo;stall&rdquo; when a <code>configure</code> script runs.</p></li></ul></li></ul><hr><p><strong><a href=/2025/01/netbsd-graphics-wo-x11.html>&ldquo;Hands-on graphics without X11&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>On January 17th, 2025</em></p><figure><img src=/images/2025-01-17-wsdisplay-devices.png></figure><ul><li><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This article presents a deep dive into NetBSD&rsquo;s console drivers and how those can be used to render graphics directly to the framebuffer without relying on X11 or Wayland.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relevance:</strong> Figuring this out was the key to unblocking the EndBOX project. I had built an earlier prototype of the OS image that used EndBASIC&rsquo;s SDL console over X11 but&mldr; the boot times were atrocious and I wasn&rsquo;t sure I could make them better. Researching how to leverage the framebuffer removed this roadblock as I could get graphics rendering almost immediately after the kernel finished booting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lessons learned:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>wsdisplay and wskbd APIs:</em> I had looked at the internals of these devices in the past but never paid much attention to the versatile APIs they expose. I had to do this now, and it was insightful.</p></li><li><p><em>gdb scripting:</em> Nothing new (I knew this was possible), but I think it was the first time I put it into practice&mldr; for the article&rsquo;s sake.</p></li></ul></li></ul><hr><p><strong><a href=/2025/02/ioctls-rust.html>&ldquo;ioctls from Rust&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>On February 13th, 2025</em></p><figure><img src=/images/2025-02-13-ioctls-rust-cover-image.jpg></figure><ul><li><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> An overview on what ioctls are and how to invoke them from Rust when bindings don&rsquo;t yet exist for them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relevance:</strong> This was a direct follow-up to the previous article: that one was focused on gaining access to the framebuffer, which I prototyped from C, and this one was about productionizing those prototypes in the form of a Rust backend for EndBASIC&rsquo;s console abstraction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lessons learned:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>ioctl formats:</em> Not all ioctls are the same. Some deal with simple data types whereas other deal with large structures&mdash;and the way they are expressed is different.</p></li><li><p><em>Integrating ioctls in Rust:</em> This was &ldquo;just a matter of programming&rdquo;, but it was cool to see how the <code>nix</code> crate makes it easy to expose ioctls in a Rust-native manner so that they just look like function calls.</p></li></ul></li></ul><hr><p><strong><a href=/2025/02/hardware-autoconfiguration.html>&ldquo;Hardware discovery: ACPI & Device Tree&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>On February 28th, 2025</em></p><figure><img src=/images/2025-02-28-w2k-device-manager.png></figure><ul><li><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> A deep dive on how device discovery works on a modern machine, including details on ACPI and Device Tree, how they differ, and how they are put in memory so that the kernel can read them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relevance:</strong> During the development of the EndBOX, I had to enable SPI to render to the LCD via a DT overlay. I also had to find and install a DTB for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W so that NetBSD could boot on this board and so that the WiFi could work too.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lessons learned:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>ACPI and Device Tree:</em> I pretty much knew nothing about these, so learning about the foundations behind them and how they differ was interesting on its own.</p></li><li><p><em>Device Tree overlays:</em> I had to write an overlay from scratch to enable the SPI bus on NetBSD&mdash;and then get the LCD to actually work (which was its own time sink).</p></li><li><p><em>Linux vs. NetBSD DTBs:</em> NetBSD reuses Linux DTBs, but NetBSD&rsquo;s copy is ancient and contains local changes (to e.g. disable the unsupported Videocore). I had to figure out, through sweat and tears, how to port the DTB for the Pi Zero 2 W from Linux to NetBSD without breaking anything else.</p></li></ul></li></ul><hr><p><strong><a href=/2025/05/beginning-3d-printing.html>&ldquo;Beginning 3D printing&rdquo;</a></strong><br><em>On May 28th, 2025</em></p><figure><img src=/images/2025-05-28-prusa-and-mac-pro.jpg></figure><ul><li><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> A beginner-level introduction to 3D printing, including 3D modeling basics, slicing, and actual printing considerations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Relevance:</strong> The final step in showing off the EndBOX was to create a case for it that matched the design I had envisioned months earlier.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lessons learned:</strong></p><ul><li><p><em>Unprintable objects:</em> The way 3D printers work imposes constraints on the kinds of items that can be printed, and I had to adjust my design a few times.</p></li><li><p><em>Modeling vs. slicing:</em> They are two very different things, and I had never imagined that the second existed.</p></li><li><p><em>It&rsquo;s not trivial:</em> Even after figuring out the basics, getting a perfect print is difficult. I guess the real world is analog and subject to imperfections.</p></li></ul></li></ul><hr><p>And that&rsquo;s all for today. If you enjoyed any of these articles, it&rsquo;s because working on the EndBOX gave me reasons to chase those topics down. To keep this kind of content going, I need time to play, explore, and tinker, so if you&rsquo;d like to support the journey, please subscribe to or sponsor the project.</p><p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href=https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jmmv>💾 Sponsor the EndBOX</a></p><p>As for what&rsquo;s next&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m starting to rethink how I can apply the lessons of the EndBOX to something more impactful. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to turn &ldquo;just a fun ride&rdquo; into something greater, because while BASIC may not be the future, the many components that have gone into building EndBASIC and the EndBOX may be.
