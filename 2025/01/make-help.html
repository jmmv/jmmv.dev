The specific problem I&rsquo;m facing is that I need to glue together the NetBSD build system, a quilt patch set, EndBASIC&rsquo;s Cargo-based Rust build, and a couple of QEMU invocations to produce a Frankenstein disk image for a Raspberry Pi. And the thing is: Make allows doing this sort of stitching with relative ease.

Anyway. When using Make in this manner, you often end up with what&rsquo;s essentially a &ldquo;command dispatcher&rdquo; and, over time, the number of commands grows and it&rsquo;s hard to make sense of which one to use for what.

It&rsquo;s all pretty terrible, but people are used to this pattern due to Make&rsquo;s ubiquity and somehow expect it when they face a Make-based project.</p><p>To implement this command dispatcher idea, each user-facing action is exposed via a <em>target</em>. These targets tend to be marked as &ldquo;phony&rdquo;&mdash;i.e. they are targets that produce no outputs of their own. Take a look at this <code>Makefile</code>:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-make data-lang=make><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nf>.PHONY</span><span class=o>:</span> <span class=n>build</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nf>build</span><span class=o>:</span> <span class=n>target</span>/<span class=n>debug</span>/<span class=n>program</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nf>target/debug/program</span><span class=o>:</span> <span class=n>src</span>/<span class=n>main</span>.<span class=n>rs</span> <span class=n>src</span>/<span class=n>lib</span>.<span class=n>rs</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>	cargo build
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>        
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nf>.PHONY</span><span class=o>:</span> <span class=n>test</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nf>test</span><span class=o>:</span> <span class=n>build</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>	cargo <span class=nb>test</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the snippet above, the <code>target/debug/program</code> target represents a built <em>file</em>. This target depends on a list of sources and specifies what command to run to generate the output when it is missing or out of date (according to file modification times, <a href=/2020/12/google-no-clean-builds.html#file-modification-times>yikes</a>). When you type <code>make target/debug/program</code>, you expect the file <code>target/debug/program</code> to exist on disk after the command completes.</p><p>But the snippet also shows two phony targets: <code>build</code> and <code>test</code>. When you type <code>make build</code> or <code>make test</code>, you do not expect neither a <code>build</code> nor a <code>test</code> file to be created, no. What you expect is that the project is built and tested. And for this, Make evaluates the dependencies of the phony targets (if any are specified, as is the case for <code>build</code>) and then unconditionally executes any commands in the phony targets (as is the case for <code>test</code>).</p><p>With this in mind, the first thing we want to do in our <code>make help</code> command is to document these &ldquo;special&rdquo; targets that represent user-facing actions. To do this, we&rsquo;ll leverage one not-well-known aspect of Make&rsquo;s syntax: the list of dependencies of a target is <em>cumulative</em> across multiple target definitions of the same name. Basically, these target definitions are equivalent:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-make data-lang=make><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=c># All dependencies in one line.
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=c></span><span class=nf>target/debug/program</span><span class=o>:</span> <span class=n>src</span>/<span class=n>main</span>.<span class=n>rs</span> <span class=n>src</span>/<span class=n>lib</span>.<span class=n>rs</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=c># Dependencies spread over multiple lines.
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=c></span><span class=nf>target/debug/program</span><span class=o>:</span> <span class=n>src</span>/<span class=n>main</span>.<span class=n>rs</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nf>target/debug/program</span><span class=o>:</span> <span class=n>src</span>/<span class=n>lib</span>.<span class=n>rs</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Knowing this, we can add &ldquo;extra&rdquo; lines for a target and use one of those to document the target so that we do not end up with super-long lines. For example, we can do:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-make data-lang=make><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nf>target/debug/program</span><span class=o>:</span> <span class=c># Builds the program.
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=c></span><span class=nf>target/debug/program</span><span class=o>:</span> <span class=n>src</span>/<span class=n>main</span>.<span class=n>rs</span> <span class=n>src</span>/<span class=n>lib</span>.<span class=n>rs</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And then we are just one <code>grep</code> away from extracting the targets and their documentation:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span class=line><span class=cl>sed -e<span class=s1>&#39;s/^\([^: 	]\+\):.*#\(.*\)$/\1 \2/p;d&#39;</span> Makefile <span class=p>|</span> column -t -l <span class=m>2</span> <span class=p>|</span> sort
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>OK fine. It&rsquo;s a bit more complicated than just <code>grep</code> because we have to reformat the lines a bit and we need to create a nicely formatted table. Also, I know the <code>sed</code> syntax is awful, but I really don&rsquo;t want to call into Perl or Python as other guides tell you just for this silly string manipulation. There are native Unix tools that can help us here, and they are much lighter-weight.</p><h1 id=variables>Variables</h1><p>All other &ldquo;self-documenting <code>Makefile</code>&rdquo; tutorials I found out there focus exclusively on documenting targets. But <code>Makefile</code>s often expose another dimension of their API, and this is the collection of user-settable configuration variables that they accept.</p><p>Many <code>Makefile</code>s do things like:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-make data-lang=make><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nv>CFLAGS</span> <span class=o>?=</span> -O2
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>&mldr; to indicate that <code>CFLAGS</code> is set to <code>-O2</code>. But note: the <code>?=</code> operator invites users to override the variable&rsquo;s value if they choose to. For example, if the user wanted to build the project in debug mode, they could probably do the following and get the code to build without optimizations and with debug symbols:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span class=line><span class=cl>$ make <span class=nv>CFLAGS</span><span class=o>=</span><span class=s2>&#34;-O0 -g&#34;</span> build
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Given that these variables are user-facing, we should document them as well as part of the <code>make help</code> output.</p><p>To document variables, we don&rsquo;t have the luxury of splitting their definition into multiple lines like we did with targets to prevent super-long lines. That said, we can still add comments at the end of the line, like shown below, and those comments won&rsquo;t be part of the variable&rsquo;s default value. It is important, however, to not leave any space between the default value and the comment, or else the spaces become part of the variable&rsquo;s value.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-make data-lang=make><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nv>DEVELOPER</span> <span class=o>?=</span> 0# Set to <span class=m>1</span> to <span class=nb>enable</span> developer builds.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Like with targets, we are also just one <code>grep</code> away from extracting the variables and their documentation:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span class=line><span class=cl>sed -e <span class=s1>&#39;s/^\([^ 	]\+\)[ 	]*?=[^#]\+#\(.*\)$/\1 \2/p;d&#39;</span> Makefile <span class=p>|</span> column -t -l <span class=m>2</span> <span class=p>|</span> sort
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Again, more complicated than just a <code>grep</code>, but you get the idea.</p><h1 id=putting-it-all-together>Putting it all together</h1><p>Alright. So now we know how to extract a table documenting targets and a table documenting variables, but these two lists may still be too obscure on their own. Which targets are important? Which variables might the user want to look into first?</p><p>To address this deficiency, we can preface those tables with some prose that explains, at a very high level, what to do when interacting with the project for the first time. To implement this, we can write the instructions in a separate file (like a <code>README.md</code>) next to the <code>Makefile</code>, and then have our <code>make help</code> command print out the text file&rsquo;s contents.</p><p>And so without further ado, here is how we can tie everything together:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-make data-lang=make><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nf>.PHONY</span><span class=o>:</span> <span class=n>help</span>
</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=nf>help</span><span class=o>:</span> <span class=c># Shows interactive help.
