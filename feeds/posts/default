Thanks to this, it&amp;rsquo;s trivial to set up an SSH server to remotely access and administer the machine, which in turn has allowed me to have a nice and powerful desktop computer which I can also leverage when I&amp;rsquo;m on the go.
Moving to Windows full time, as I briefly touched upon in My story with Windows, required that I could do the same on this platform.</description></item><item><title>My story with Windows</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/my-story-with-windows.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 05:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/my-story-with-windows.html</guid><description>&lt;p>It has been a year since I went all-in on Windows as my daily driver. I had been off this platform for more than 25 years, spending the first 10 of those on Linux and the BSDs, and the latter 15 on macOS alone. This switch is A Big Deal™️&amp;mdash;to me at least.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to tell you how Windows 10 and 11 feel these days to someone who hadn&amp;rsquo;t touched this OS for a long time. But, before I can do that, let me tell you my story with Windows. This might be boring so I&amp;rsquo;ve sprinkled some images to evoke retro feelings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Comments are back and other news</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/comments-and-ids.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/02/comments-and-ids.html</guid><description>Just a couple of weeks ago, I described my home-grown analytics service for this site.

uBlock showing a warning that it blocked a tracker on the EndBASIC site. A tracking warning. uBlock complained that my properties had one tracker. And it&amp;rsquo;s true they had just one: it was Google Analytics, or GA for short.
GA is the de-facto standard for web analytics: it is extremely powerful and ubiquitous.</description></item><item><title>Fair on-call scheduling</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2022/01/oncall-scheduling.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 06:40:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2022/01/oncall-scheduling.html</guid><description>Being part of an on-call rotation is a requirement for many software job positions and fulfilling this requirement should not come with stress. One process that can cause friction is how a team schedules its on-call shifts. If the on-call scheduling process is haphazard, team members will end up with shifts over their personal plans, and they&amp;rsquo;ll be unhappy. But there are ways to prevent this, which is what this post is about.</description></item><item><title>Constructors and evil initializers in C++</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/11/cpp-ctors-vs-init.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 09:15:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/11/cpp-ctors-vs-init.html</guid><description>One of the three key tenets of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is encapsulation: objects contain a state that, when observed from the outside, is always internally-consistent. Unfortunately, C++ codebases where exceptions are forbidden often violate this rule when they separate object initialization from construction. Let&amp;rsquo;s see why that&amp;rsquo;s a problem and how to address it.</description></item><item><title>EndBASIC 0.8: Now, with graphics!</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/11/endbasic-0.8.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 09:45:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/11/endbasic-0.8.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Graphics support has finally landed in EndBASIC and, with that, the 0.8 release is finally here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This release marks a huge milestone in the development of EndBASIC. Supporting graphics is something I&amp;rsquo;ve had in mind since the very beginning but had been procrastinating on until a couple of months ago. I feared everything that would be involved in delivering this feature, and to be fair, I was right: getting the desktop console to work on all platforms, and especially getting it to work in CI for automated testing, was tedious. But it&amp;rsquo;s done now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Useless use of GNU</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/08/useless-use-of-gnu.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 09:10:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/08/useless-use-of-gnu.html</guid><description>The GNU project is the source of the Unix userland utilities used on most Linux distributions. Its compatibility with standards and other Unix systems, or lack thereof, directly impacts the overall portability of any piece of software developed from GNU/Linux installations. Unfortunately, the GNU userland does not closely adhere to standards, and its widespread usage causes little incompatibilities to creep into any software created on GNU/Linux systems. Read on for why this is a problem and the pitfalls you will encounter.</description></item><item><title>Should the browser use all available memory?</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/08/using-all-memory-as-a-cache.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 09:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/08/using-all-memory-as-a-cache.html</guid><description>We have all seen discussions go like this: someone first complains that an application like Google Chrome is wasteful because it uses multiple GBs of memory. Someone else comes along and says that memory is there to be used for speed and therefore this is the correct behavior: if the computer has multiple GBs of free memory, an application such as Chrome should make use of all the available memory in the form of a cache to be as responsive as possible. Makes sense, right? Yes, it does makes sense&amp;mdash;as long as Chrome is the only application running. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore why this is not a great idea.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jmmv.dev/software/endtracker.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/software/endtracker.html</guid><description>Dynamic features for static sites</description></item><item><title>Principal engineers should be on-call</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/07/principal-engineers-oncall.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 06:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/07/principal-engineers-oncall.html</guid><description>&lt;p>A recent tweet that caught my attention read: &amp;ldquo;principal engineers should be on-call&amp;rdquo;. Of course they should be! I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;surprised&amp;rdquo; they aren&amp;rsquo;t everywhere, but I can imagine some reasons to justify their situation.

But why? Is this just a stylistic issue or is there something deeper to warrant making the change? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at stack frames, C, and then C++ to answer these questions.</description></item><item><title>macOS keyboard shortcuts for Windows</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/07/macos-ahk.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/07/macos-ahk.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Are you a macOS user occasionally dealing with Windows systems or trying to switch platforms? Are you a Windows user that believes that the Windows-native keyboard shortcuts are objectively bad? Are you annoyed by something as simple as copy/pasting text not working consistently across apps?&lt;/p>

That changes today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After about four months of work, I am ecstatic to announce that EndBASIC 0.7 is here. And these haven&amp;rsquo;t been four months of idle time. No, no, no. It has taken four months of my scarce free time to deliver this because 0.7 is a humongous release on various fronts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From FeedBurner to follow.it</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2021/07/feedburner-to-follow-it-migration.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 21:10:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2021/07/feedburner-to-follow-it-migration.html</guid><description>An announcement that explains why this blog has had to migrate from FeedBurner-based email subscriptions to a new service offered by follow.it.
