      <title>How does Google avoid clean builds?</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/google-no-clean-builds.html</link>

      <description>During my 11 years at Google, I can confidently count the number of times I had to do a &amp;ldquo;clean build&amp;rdquo; with one hand: their build system is so robust that incremental builds always work. Phrases like &amp;ldquo;clean everything and try building from scratch&amp;rdquo; are unheard of. So&amp;hellip; you can color me skeptical when someone says that incremental build problems are due to bugs in the build files and not due to a suboptimal build system. The answer lies in having a robust build system, and in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll examine the common causes behind incremental build breakages, what the build system can do to avoid them, and how Bazel accomplishes most of them.</description>

      <title>EndBASIC 0.4 release announcement</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/endbasic-0.4.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/endbasic-0.4.html</guid>
      <description>About a month ago and after a long hiatus, I published EndBASIC 0.3 and the adrenaline rush that came with it got my wheels spinning again full-steam ahead. So here I am today, ready to announce the 0.4 release. But&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;what could have possibly changed in just a month of someone&amp;rsquo;s free time&amp;rdquo;, you wonder? Enough, actually!
EndBASIC 0.4 is the release that fulfills my original goal of being able to run a &amp;ldquo;guess the number&amp;rdquo; game.</description>

      <title>Unit-testing a console app (a text editor)</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/unit-testing-a-console-app.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/unit-testing-a-console-app.html</guid>
      <description>The most notable feature in EndBASIC 0.3 is its new full-screen console-based text editor. In this post, I describe why it is important and useful to unit-test a console app like this, and I will dive into how to implement unit tests that catch regressions and inefficiencies. Code samples are in Rust, but the concepts presented here are applicable to any language with minimal data abstraction facilities.</description>

      <title>Using the builder pattern to define test scenarios</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the builder patter to express test scenarios in a succinct and declarative manner. I&amp;rsquo;ve liked the outcome and feel that this design can yield to pretty good test code, so I&amp;rsquo;ll dig through this idea here. Note that, while this post and the associated code talk about Rust, &lt;strong&gt;the ideas presented here apply to any language&lt;/strong&gt;. So don&amp;rsquo;t leave just because I said Rust!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>EndBASIC 0.3 is here</title>

      <description>After a 6-month long hiatus caused by me hunting and changing jobs and cities, I am pleased to announce the release of EndBASIC 0.3! The Thanksgiving break has been as fruitful as I had hoped üòÅ
There are two major changes in this release.
  The first is the official debut of the web-based interface. I introduced this months ago and have had it running on a &amp;ldquo;push on green&amp;rdquo; model, which means that the web deployment of EndBASIC is always tracking Git HEAD.</description>

      <title>What makes an article succeed (or not)?</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/successful-articles.html</link>

      <description>This is what landing on the Hacker News front page does to your usually-dormant site:
 Number of total daily visitors of this site over the last few days.  In other words, this is what the Windows Subsystem for Linux: The lost potential post caused:
 a ridiculous jump from the usual ~80 visits per day to 6,000 on day one, 9,000 on day two, and 1,000 on day three; 200 comments on Hacker News in less than 24 hours and a ripple of discussions in Reddit and OSnews; a very insightful chat with a long-term NTFS engineer on general system performance; and an incredibly poor conversion rate with only 5 new Twitter followers and 3 new email subscribers.</description>

      <title>Windows Subsystem for Linux: The lost potential</title>

      <description>If you have followed Windows 10 at all during the last few years, you know that the Windows Subsystem for Linux, or WSL for short, is the hot topic among developers. You can finally run your Linux tooling on Windows as a first class citizen, which means you no longer have to learn PowerShell or, god forbid, suffer through the ancient CMD.EXE console.
Unfortunately, not everything is as rosy as it sounds.</description>

      <title>Updating Google Domains from DD-WRT</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/dd-wrt-google-domains.html</link>

      <description>I have had a Netgear WNDR3700v2 router for a few years already and I bought this model specifically because I could flash it with the open-source DD-WRT firmware. The reasons remain the same as the ones I had in 2006&amp;mdash;the key ones being: the ability to run a Dnsmasq DNS/DHCP server for my local network; and the ability to update a single Dynamic DNS address so that I can access my home network when I&amp;rsquo;m on the go.</description>

      <title>Argument processing in Unix and Windows</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/11/cmdline-args-unix-vs-windows.html</link>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s continue our dive into the very interesting topic of how Unix (or Linux or what have you) and Windows differ regarding argument processing. And by that I mean: how a program (the caller) communicates the set of arguments to pass to another program (the callee) at execution time, how the callee receives such arguments, and what are the consequences of each design.</description>

      <title>Configuring Windows for key-based SSH access</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/windows-ssh-access.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/windows-ssh-access.html</guid>
      <description>Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 both ship with OpenSSH (server and client). Installing these components is a breeze, but the official documentation to set everything up is either wrong or incomplete. I wanted to set up key-based authentication and this took quite a bit of poking until I figured out all the right knobs. Here are the lab notes from my adventure.</description>

      <title>Flags parsing in PowerShell (vs. Unix)</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/powershell-cmdlet-params.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/powershell-cmdlet-params.html</guid>
      <description>The way PowerShell handles flags in scripts (aka cmdlets) differs completely from what Unix shells do. These differences allow PowerShell to gain insight on how scripts have to be executed, which in turn can deliver a better interactive user experience. Read on for a comparison while wearing Unix-tinted glasses.</description>

      <description>After a little over 11 years, it&amp;rsquo;s time for a much longed change: I&amp;rsquo;m leaving Google and I&amp;rsquo;m joining Microsoft as a Principal Software Engineer for Azure. These job changes are effective as of this week, but my family and I already moved from New York City to Redmond, WA about three weeks ago. Read on for a recap on my tenure at Google, the whys behind my departure, and how I ended up choosing the position in Microsoft Azure after mulling over offers from Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft.</description>

      <title>The final boss: Bazel&#39;s own JNI code</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/10/bazel-jni.html</link>

      <description>As you might have read elsewhere, I&amp;rsquo;m leaving the Bazel team and Google in about a week. My plan for these last few weeks was to hand things off as cleanly as possible&amp;hellip; but I was also nerd-sniped by a bug that came my way a fortnight ago. Fixing it has been my self-inflicted punishment for leaving, and oh my, it has been painful. Very painful.
Let me tell you the story of this final boss.</description>

      <title>Bazel output streaming, Ctrl&#43;C, and test flakiness</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/09/bazel-test-streaming-bug.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 2020 07:10:00 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2020/09/bazel-test-streaming-bug.html</guid>
      <description>About two weeks ago, I found a very interesting bug in Bazel&amp;rsquo;s test output streaming functionality while writing tests for a new feature related to Ctrl+C interrupts. I fixed the bug, wrote a test for it, and&amp;hellip; the test itself came back as flaky, which made me find another very subtle bug in the test that needed a one-line fix. This is the story of both.
 Bazel has a feature known as test output streaming: by default, Bazel captures the outputs (stdout and stderr) of the tests it runs, saves those in local log files, and tells the user where they are when a test fails.</description>
