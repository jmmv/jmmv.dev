&lt;p>But uh&amp;hellip; wait, what is Kyua and why is this exciting? To resolve confusion and celebrate this milestone, I&amp;rsquo;d like to revisit what Kyua is, how it came to be, why I stopped working on it for a while, why that was a problem for FreeBSD&amp;mdash;and, indirectly, NetBSD&amp;mdash;and how Kyua being free software has helped keep it alive.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-08-02-kyua-graduates.jpg" length="367311" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Rust doesn't solve the CrowdStrike outage</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/07/crowdstrike-and-rust.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 07:10:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/07/crowdstrike-and-rust.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Look, I like Rust. I really, really do, and I agree with the premise that memory-unsafe languages like C++ should not be used anymore. But claiming that Rust would have &lt;em>prevented&lt;/em> the massive outage that the world went through last Friday is misleading and actively harmful to Rust&amp;rsquo;s evangelism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having CrowdStrike written in Rust would have &lt;em>minimized&lt;/em> the chances of the outage happening, but not resolved the root cause that allowed the outage to happen in the first place. Thus, it irks me to see various folks blanket-claiming that Rust is the answer. It&amp;rsquo;s not, and pushing this agenda hurts Rust&amp;rsquo;s adoption more than it helps: C++ experts can understand the root cause and see that this claim is misleading, causing further divide in the systems programming world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, why won&amp;rsquo;t Rust help? Let me try to answer that question, but while we are at it, let&amp;rsquo;s also delve deeper into the causes of the outage. In a way, let me put my SRE hat on and write my own version of the postmortem.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-07-23-rusty-crow.jpg" length="343660" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>20 years of blogging</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/06/20-years-of-blogging.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/06/20-years-of-blogging.html</guid><description>Blog System/5 hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been called this way and it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been my first experience with blogging either. In fact, today marks the 20th anniversary of this publication in its various incarnations so it&amp;rsquo;s time for a bit of reflection.
Just to set context for when 20 years ago was: Windows XP was almost 3 years old, Ubuntu had just debuted, Apple computers were still PowerPC-based, Half Life 2 was about to launch, and Slashdot was the place to be instead of the yet-to-be-created Hacker News.</description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-06-22-livejournal-20041126.png" length="140932" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Porting the EndBASIC console to an LCD</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/04/endbasic-st7735s.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 13:30:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/04/endbasic-st7735s.html</guid><description>Hello again Blog System/5 and sorry for the radio silence for the last couple of months. I had been writing too much in here and neglecting my side projects so I needed to get back to them. And now that I&amp;rsquo;ve made significant progress on cool new features for EndBASIC, it&amp;rsquo;s time to write about them a little!
One of the defining characteristics of EndBASIC is its hybrid console: what looks like a simple text terminal at first glance can actually render overlapping graphics and text at the same time.</description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-04-26-endbasic-st7735s-editor.jpg" length="2750893" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>How "new type" helps avoid production outages</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/03/new-type-and-production-outages.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2024 09:50:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/03/new-type-and-production-outages.html</guid><description>My January links recap included the &amp;ldquo;Phantom Types&amp;rdquo; article by David Soria Parra. In it, the author briefly touches upon the &amp;ldquo;new type&amp;rdquo; idiom, its typical implementation in Rust, and then proceeds to propose a better alternative. But the question arises: why should you care?
To answer why this idiom is useful, I want to present you with a real production problem we faced in the Storage Infrastructure team at Google circa 2010.</description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-03-09-new-types-store.jpg" length="552435" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: February 2024 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/02/links-february-2024-edition.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Feb 2024 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/02/links-february-2024-edition.html</guid><description>Hi folks! Another month has passed so it&amp;rsquo;s time for a brief recap of the main news, articles, and projects that made the rounds during this period and are on topic for Blog System/5.
As usual, this is not just a list: every entry is accompanied by a short blurb detailing why I found the content interesting, which is meant to nudge you into reading it! Also, the list is ordered by when the links made it my way, not chronologically, and some items are not from this time period.</description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-02-29-links.jpg" length="243606" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>To C or not to C</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/02/to-c-or-not-to-c.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2024 06:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/02/to-c-or-not-to-c.html</guid><description>Over the last few days, there has been this&amp;hellip; debate over at Twitter sparked by a claim that you cannot be a good programmer without knowing C. You obviously can be one, but there is some nuance in what &amp;ldquo;knowing&amp;rdquo; C is truly about. Here is my take on the matter.
Let me repeat this first: of course you can be a perfectly good programmer without knowing C. Knowing a language doesn&amp;rsquo;t make or break a programmer, and there are great programmers out there that don&amp;rsquo;t touch C.</description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-02-21-to-c-or-not-to-c.png" length="326255" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Running GNU on DOS with DJGPP</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/02/djgpp.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Feb 2024 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/02/djgpp.html</guid><description>&lt;p>The recent deep dive into &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/the-ides-we-had-30-years-ago.html">the IDEs of the DOS times 30 years ago&lt;/a> made me reminisce of DJGPP, a distribution of the GNU development tools for DOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I remember using DJGPP back in the 1990s before I had been exposed to Linux and feeling that it was a strange beast. Compared to the Microsoft C Compiler and Turbo C++, the tooling was bloated and alien to DOS, and the resulting binaries were huge. But DJGPP provided a complete development environment &lt;em>for free&lt;/em>, which I got from a monthly magazine, and I could even look at its source code if I wished. You can&amp;rsquo;t imagine what a big deal that was at the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But even if I could look under the cover, I never did. I never really understood why was DJGPP so strange, slow, and huge, or why it even existed. Until now. As I&amp;rsquo;m in the mood of looking back, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last couple of months figuring out what the foundations of this software were and how it actually worked. Part of this research has resulted in the previous two posts on DOS memory management. And part of this research is this article. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look!&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-02-14-djgpp-cover-image.png" length="253620" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Beyond the 1 MB barrier in DOS</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/02/beyond-the-1-mb-barrier-in-dos.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2024 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/02/beyond-the-1-mb-barrier-in-dos.html</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2024/01/from-0-to-1-mb-in-dos.html">&amp;ldquo;From 0 to 1 MB in DOS&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, I presented an overview of all the ways in which DOS and its applications tried to maximize the use of the 1 MB address space inherited from the 8086&amp;mdash;even after the 80286 introduced support for 16 MB of memory and the 80386 opened the gates to 4 GB.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know I promised that this follow-up article would be about DJGPP, but before getting into &lt;em>that&lt;/em> review, I realized I had to take another detour to cover three more topics. Namely: &lt;em>unreal mode&lt;/em>, which I intentionally ignored to not derail the post; &lt;em>LOADALL&lt;/em>, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about until you readers mentioned it; and &lt;em>DOS extenders&lt;/em>, which I was planning to describe in the DJGPP article but they are a better fit for this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; strap your seat belts on and dive right in for another tour through the ancient techniques that DOS had to pull off to peek into the memory address space above the first MB. And get your hands ready because we&amp;rsquo;ll go over assembly code for a step-by-step jump into unreal mode.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-02-07-80386-dos.jpg" length="152971" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: January 2024 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/01/links-january-2024-edition.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 10:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/01/links-january-2024-edition.html</guid><description>&lt;p>It is hard to believe but we are already one month into 2024. January has flown by for me and I haven&amp;rsquo;t done a good job at keeping up with news sites&amp;hellip; but I have been reading them on and off and I have collected a small set of interesting articles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To everyone new around here, hello and thanks for subscribing! For some context, what follows is my manual selection of cool articles, videos, and projects I stumbled upon during this time period. However, this is not just a dump of links: each link is accompanied by a short commentary to justifies why I thought the material was interesting, why it is relevant to this publication and, more importantly, an attempt to nudge you into reading the source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s get to it.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2023-10-31-links.png" length="56457" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>From 0 to 1 MB in DOS</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2024/01/from-0-to-1-mb-in-dos.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2024 09:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2024/01/from-0-to-1-mb-in-dos.html</guid><description>&lt;p>Since the last article on &lt;a href="https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/the-ides-we-had-30-years-ago.html">the text-based IDEs of old&lt;/a>, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write about the GCC port to DOS, namely &lt;a href="https://www.delorie.com/djgpp/">DJGPP&lt;/a>. As I worked on the draft for that topic, I realized that there is a ton of ground to cover to set the stage so I took most of the content on memory management out and wrote this separate post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article is a deep dive on how DOS had to pull out tricks to maximize the use of the very limited 1 MB address space of the 8086. Those tricks could exist because of the features later introduced by the 80286 and the 80386, but these were just clutches to paper over the fact that DOS could not leverage the real improvements provided by protected mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This detour is long but I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy it as much as I enjoyed researching the topic. I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the changes in the x86 architecture over time, starting with the 8086 and ending in the 80386, and how DOS kept up along the way. I&amp;rsquo;ll conclude with a peek into DOS&amp;rsquo; own &lt;tt>MEM&lt;/tt> and MemMaker utilities. I must omit details to keep the text manageable in size though, so please excuse the lack of detail in some areas; just follow the links to external documentation to learn more.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://jmmv.dev/images/2024-01-17-8086-dos.jpg" length="220943" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Links: December 2023 edition</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/links-december-2023-edition.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 09:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/links-december-2023-edition.html</guid><description>December draws to a close as does 2023, which means it&amp;rsquo;s time for yet another monthly links recap.

Back then, I did not fully comprehend what I was doing and why the tools I used were impressive given the constraints of the hardware we had. Having gained more knowledge throughout the years, it is now really fun to pick up DOSBox to re-experience those programs and compare them with our current state of affairs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time around, I want to look at the pure text-based IDEs that we had in that era before Windows eclipsed the PC industry. I want to do this because those IDEs had little to envy from the IDEs of today&amp;mdash;yet it feels as if we went through a dark era where we lost most of those features for years and they are only resurfacing now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If anything, stay for a nostalgic ride back in time and a little rant on &amp;ldquo;bloat&amp;rdquo;. But, more importantly, read on to gain perspective on what existed before so that you can evaluate future feature launches more critically.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bazel interview at Software Engineering Daily</title><link>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/bazel-interview-at-software-engineering.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 09:50:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://jmmv.dev/2023/12/bazel-interview-at-software-engineering.html</guid><description>Just a bit over 2 months ago, on October 5th, 2023, Jordi Mon Companys interviewed me about Bazel for an episode in the Software Engineering Daily podcast.
