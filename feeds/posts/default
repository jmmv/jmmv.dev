      <description>Here I am, confined to my apartment due to the COVID-19 pandemic and without having posted anything for almost two months. Fortunately, my family and I are still are in good condition, and I&amp;rsquo;m even more fortunate to have a job that can employ me remotely without problems. Or can they?
For over a year, my team and I have been working on allowing our mobile engineers to work from their laptops (as opposed to from their powerful workstations).</description>

      <description>FOSDEM 2020 is over. As I type this, I&amp;rsquo;m on my way back home from the conference in Brussels. And it has been nice. In the end. I must confess I was frustrated by the middle of the first day, though things got better after that.
Here is the thing: FOSDEM is not your usual conference. There are lots of things going on at once and all of them are crowded.</description>

      <title>Ensuring system rewrites are truly necessary</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2020/01/system-rewrites-and-tuning.html</link>

      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say that software engineers&amp;mdash;hey, I&amp;rsquo;m one one myself!&amp;mdash;often dream about what the rewrite of a system would look like if they had the chance to start over. Oh so much more usable. Oh so much better structured. Oh so much faster! We are architects after all.
And it might be true that a rewrite can deliver those benefits. But often enough, we are too quick to let our minds wander into that territory.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone and welcome to this new decade!
It&amp;rsquo;s already 2020 and I&amp;rsquo;m only 17 days late in writing a first post. I was planning to start with an opinion article, but as its draft is taking longer than I wanted&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll present you the story of a recent crazy bug that has kept me busy for the last couple of days.
Java crashes with Bazel and sandboxfs On a machine running macOS Catalina, install sandboxfs and build Bazel with sandboxfs enabled, like this:</description>

      <title>Tree artifacts and transient files</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2019/12/bazel-dynamic-execution-tree-artifacts.html</link>

      <description>To conclude the deep dive into Bazel&amp;rsquo;s dynamic spawn strategy, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the nightmare that tree artifacts have been with the local lock-free feature. And, yes, I&amp;rsquo;m double-posting today because I really want to finish these series before the end of the decade1!
Tree artifacts are a fancy name for action outputs that are directories, not files. What&amp;rsquo;s special about them is that Bazel does not know a priori what the directory contents are: the rule behind the action just specifies that there will be a directory with files, and Bazel has to treat that as the unit of output from the action.</description>

      <title>Lifting the local lock for dynamic execution</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2019/12/bazel-dynamic-execution-local-lockfree.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2019/12/bazel-dynamic-execution-local-lockfree.html</guid>
      <description>In the previous post, we saw how accounting for artifact download times makes the dynamic strategy live to its promise of delivering the best of local and remote build times.
Or does it? If you think about it closely, that change made it so that builds that were purely local couldn&amp;rsquo;t be made worse by enabling the dynamic scheduler: the dynamic strategy would always favor the local branch of a spawn if the remote one took a long time.</description>

      <description>In the previous post of this series, we looked at how the now-legacy implementation of the dynamic strategy uses a per-spawn lock to guard accesses to the output tree. This lock is problematic for a variety of reasons and we are going to peek into one of those here.
To recap, the remote strategy does the following:
 Send spawn execution RPC to the remote service. Wait for successful execution (which can come quickly from a cache hit).</description>

      <title>Output conflicts and dynamic execution</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2019/12/bazel-dynamic-execution-output-locking.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2019/12/bazel-dynamic-execution-output-locking.html</guid>
      <description>When the dynamic scheduler is active, Bazel runs the same spawn (aka command line) remotely and locally at the same time via two separate strategies. These two strategies want to write to the same output files (e.g. object files, archives, or final binaries) on the local disk. In computing, two things trying to affect the same thing require some kind of coördination.
You might think, however, that because we assume that both strategies are equivalent and will write the same contents to disk1, this is not problematic.</description>

      <title>Bazel&#39;s dynamic strategy</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2019/12/bazel-dynamic-execution-strategy.html</link>

      <description>After introducing Bazel&amp;rsquo;s dynamic execution a couple of posts ago, it&amp;rsquo;s time to dive into its actual implementation details as promised. But pardon for the interruption in the last post, as I had to take a little detour to cover a necessary topic (local resources) for today&amp;rsquo;s article.
Simply put, dynamic execution is implemented as &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; one more strategy called dynamic. The dynamic strategy, however, is different from all others because it does not have a corresponding spawn runner.</description>

      <title>How does Bazel track local resource usage?</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2019/12/bazel-local-resources.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2019/12/bazel-local-resources.html</guid>
      <description>How does Bazel avoid melting your workstation with concurrent subprocesses? Or&amp;hellip; tries to, because I know it still does that sometimes? There are two mechanisms as play: the jobs number and the local resources tracker. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into them.
The jobs number, given by the --jobs flag, configures the number of concurrent Skyframe evaluators during the execution phase1. What a mouthful. What this essentially means is that jobs indicates the number of threads used to walk the graph looking for actions to execute&amp;mdash;and also executing them.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Bazel&#39;s dynamic execution</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2019/12/bazel-dynamic-execution-introduction.html</link>

      <description>Bazel&amp;rsquo;s dynamic execution is a feature that makes your builds faster by using remote and local resources, transparently and at the same time. We launched this feature in Bazel 0.21 back in February 2019 along an introductory blog post and have been hard at work since then to improve it.
The reason dynamic execution makes builds faster is two-fold:
 first, because we can hide hiccups in the connectivity to the remote build service; and, second, because we can take advantage of things like persistent workers, which are designed to offer super-fast edit/build/test cycles.</description>

      <title>What are Bazel&#39;s strategies?</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Strategies? Will you talk about Bazel&amp;rsquo;s strategy for world domination 🙀?&amp;rdquo; No&amp;hellip; not exactly that.
Dynamic execution has been quite a hot topic in my work over the last few months and I am getting ready to publish a series of posts on it soon. But before I do that, I need to first review Bazel&amp;rsquo;s execution strategies because they play a big role in understanding what dynamic execution is and how it&amp;rsquo;s implemented.</description>

      <title>The /bin/bash baggage of macOS</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2019/11/macos-bash-baggage.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2019/11/macos-bash-baggage.html</guid>
      <description>As you may know, macOS ships with an ancient version of the Bash shell interpreter under /bin/bash. On an up-to-date Catalina installation, we get:
$ /bin/bash --version GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin19) Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  which is&amp;hellip; old. Bash 3.2.57 was released on November 7th, 2014&amp;mdash;five years ago. The most recent version is 5.0 from the beginning of this year&amp;mdash;so it&amp;rsquo;s not like nothing has changed since then.</description>

      <title>Waiting for process groups, macOS edition</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2019/11/wait-for-process-group-darwin.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2019/11/wait-for-process-group-darwin.html</guid>
      <description>In the previous posts, we saw why waiting for a process group is complicated and we covered a specific, bullet-proof mechanism to accomplish this on Linux. Now is the time to investigate this same topic on macOS. Remember that the problem we are trying to solve (#10245) is the following: given a process group, wait for all of its processes to fully terminate.
macOS has a bunch of fancy features that other systems do not have, but process control is not among them.</description>

      <title>Waiting for process groups, Linux edition</title>
      <link>https://jmmv.dev/2019/11/wait-for-process-group-linux.html</link>

      <guid>https://jmmv.dev/2019/11/wait-for-process-group-linux.html</guid>
      <description>In the previous post, we saw why waiting for a process group to terminate is important (at least in the context of Bazel), and we also saw why this is a difficult thing to do in a portable manner. So today, let&amp;rsquo;s dive into how to do this properly on a Linux system.
On Linux, we have two routes: using the child subreaper feature or using PID namespaces. We&amp;rsquo;ll focus on the former because that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;ll use to fix (#10245) the process wrapper1, and because they are sufficient to fully address our problem.</description>
