started contributing to this packaging system when I first tried NetBSD
in 2001 by sending new packages for small tools, and I later became a
very active contributor while maintaining the GNOME packages. My active
involvement came to an end a few years ago when I switched to OS X, but
I still maintain a few packages and use pkgsrc in my multiple machines:
a couple of NetBSD systems and 3 OS X machines.</p><p>Anyway. pkgsrc is obviously not everything in this world, and if I
realistically want other people to use my software, there <em>have to</em> be
binary packages for more mainstream systems. Let&rsquo;s face it: nobody in
their sane mind is going to come over to my project pages, download the
source package, mess around with dependencies that do not have binary
packages either, and install the results. Supposedly, I would need <em>just
one</em> such person, which by coincidence would also be a packager of a
mainstream distribution, to go through all these hoops and create the
corresponding binary packages. Ah yes, what I said: not gonna happen
anytime soon.</p><p>Sooooo&mldr; I spent part of past week learning (again) how to create
binary packages for Fedora and, to bring this into practice, I prepared
an <a href=https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/lutok>RPM of lutok</a>
and pushed it to Fedora rawhide and Fedora 16. All in all, it has been a
very pleasant experience, and the whole point of this post is to provide
a small summary of the things I have noticed. Because I know pretty well
how pkgsrc behaves and what its major selling points are, I am going to
provide some pkgsrc-related comments in the text below.</p><p><em>Please note that the text below lacks many details and that it may
claim some facts that are not completely accurate. I&rsquo;m still a novice in
Fedora development land.</em></p><p>First, let&rsquo;s start describing the basic components of a package
definition:</p><ul><li><p><strong>spec file:</strong> The spec file of a package is RPM&rsquo;s &ldquo;source description&rdquo;
of how to build a package (pkgsrc&rsquo;s Makefile) and also includes all
the package&rsquo;s metadata (pkgsrc&rsquo;s PLIST, DESCR, etc.). This does not
include patches nor the original sources. I must confess that having
all the details in a single file is very convenient.</p></li><li><p><strong>File lists:</strong> Contrary to (common?) misconception, spec files can and
do have an explicit list of the files to be included in the package
(same as pkgsrc&rsquo;s PLIST). This list can include wildcards to make
package maintenance easier (e.g. you can avoid having to list all
files generated by Doxygen and just include the directory name,
which will just do the right thing). No matter what you do, the
build system will ensure that all files generated by the package are
part of the file list to ensure that the package is complete.</p></li><li><p><strong>SRPMs:</strong> Think about this as a tarball of <em>all</em> the files you
need to build a particular package, including the spec file, the
source tarball and any additional patches. These files are very
convenient to move the source package around (e.g. to publish the
package for review or to copy it to a different machine for
rebuilding) and also to upload the package to Koji&rsquo;s build system
(see below).</p></li><li><p><strong>Subpackages:</strong> Oh my&mldr; what a relief compared to pkgsrc&rsquo;s approach to
this. Creating multiple independent packages from a single spec file
is <em>trivial</em>, to the point where providing subpackages is encouraged
rather than being a hassle. For what is worth, I have always liked
the idea of splitting development files from main packages (in the
case of libraries), which in many cases helps in trimming down
dependencies. pkgsrc fails miserably here: if you have ever
attempted to split a package into subpackages to control the
dependencies, you know what a pain the process is&mldr; and the results
are a collection of unreadable Makefiles.</p></li></ul><p>Now let&rsquo;s talk a bit about guidelines and access control:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Policies:</strong> I was going to write about documentation in this point,
but what I really wanted to talk about are policies. There are
several policies governing packaging rules, and the important thing
is that they are actually documented (rather than being tribal
knowledge). The other nice thing is that their documentation is
excellent; just take a moment to skim through the <a href=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines>Packaging
Guidelines</a> page
and you will see what I mean. The packaging committee is in charge
of editing these policies whenever necessary.</p></li><li><p><strong>Review process:</strong> Any new package must go through a peer review
process. Having grown accustomed to Google&rsquo;s policy of having every
single change to the source tree peer-reviewed, I can&rsquo;t stress how
valuable this is. It may seem like a burden to newcomers, but
really, it is definitely worth it. The review process is quite
exhaustive, and from what I have seen so far, the reviewers tend to
be nice and reasonable. As an example, take a look at <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=785619">lutok&rsquo;s
review</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Repository and ACLs:</strong> The source files that describe a package
(mainly a spec file and a sources file) are stored in a Git
repository (I believe there is a different repository for every
package, but I may be wrong). This is nothing unusual, but the nice
thing is that each package has its own read/write ACLs. New
maintainers have access to their own packages only, which means that
the barrier of entry can be lowered while resting assured that such
contributors cannot harm the rest of the packages until they have
gained enough trust. Of course, there are a set of trusted
developers that can submit changes to any and every package.</p></li></ul><p>&ldquo;But you said packaging infrastructure in the title!&rdquo;, you say. I know,
I know, and this is what I wanted to talk most about, so here it goes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Common tools:</strong> Other than the well-known rpm and yum utilities,
developers have access to rpmbuild and fedpkg. rpmbuild would be
rpm&rsquo;s counterpart, in the sense that it is the lowest level of
automation and exposes many details to the developer. fedpkg,
on the other hand, is a nice wrapper around the whole packaging
process (involving git, mock builds, etc.).</p></li><li><p><strong><a href=http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/>Koji</a>:</strong> Koji is Fedora&rsquo;s build
system, ready to build packages for you on demand from a simple
command-line or web interface. Koji can be used to test the build of
packages during the development process on architectures that the
developer does not have (the so-called &ldquo;scratch builds&rdquo;). However,
Koji is mainly used to generate the final binary packages that are
pushed into the distribution. Once the packager imports a new source
package into the repository, he triggers the build of binary
packages to include them later into the distribution.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href=https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates>Bodhi</a>:</strong> Bodhi is Fedora&rsquo;s
update publishing system. When a packager creates a new version of a
particular package and wishes to push such update to a formal
release (say, Fedora 16), the update is first posted in Bodhi. Then,
there are a set of scripts, rules and peer reviews that either
approve the update for publication on the branch or not.</p></li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s now talk a bit about pkgsrc&rsquo;s waived strengths and how they
compare to Fedora&rsquo;s approach:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Mass fixes:</strong> In pkgsrc, whenever a developer wants to change the
infrastructure, he can do the change himself and later adjust all
existing packages to conform to the modification. In Fedora, because
some particular developers have write access to all packages, it
seems certainly possible to apply a major fix and/or rototill to all
packages in the same manner as is done in pkgsrc. Such developer
could also trigger a rebuilt of all affected packages using a
specific branch for testing purposes and later ensure that the
modified packages still work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Isolated builds:</strong> buildlink3 is an awesome pkgsrc technology that
isolates the build of a particular package from the rest of the
system by means of symlinks and wrapper scripts. However, pkgsrc is
not
alone. <a href=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock>Mock</a> is
Fedora&rsquo;s alternative to this: Mock provides a mechanism to build
packages in a chroot environment to generate deterministic packages.
The tools used to generate the &ldquo;blessed&rdquo; binary packages for a
distribution (aka Koji) use this system to ensure the packages are
sane.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bulk builds:</strong> This is a term very familiar to pkgsrc developers, so
I&rsquo;m just mentioning it en-passing because this is also doable in
RPM-land. While package maintainers are responsible for building the
binary packages of the software they maintain (through Koji),
authorized users (e.g. release engineering) can trigger rebuilds of
any or all packages.</p></li></ul><p>And, lastly, let&rsquo;s raise the few criticisms I have up to this point:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Lack of abstractions:</strong> spec files seem rather arcane compared to
pkgsrc Makefiles when it comes to generalizing packaging concepts.
What I mean by this is that spec files seem to duplicate lots of
logic that would better be abstracted in the infrastructure itself.
For example: if a package installs libraries, it is its
responsibility to call ldconfig during installation and
deinstallation. I have seen that some things that used to be needed
in spec files a few years ago are now optional because they have
moved into the infrastructure, but I believe there is much more that
could be done. (RHEL backwards compatibility hurts here.) pkgsrc
deals with these situations automatically depending on the platform,
and extending the pkgsrc infrastructure to support more &ldquo;corner
cases&rdquo; is easier.</p></li><li><p><strong>No multi-OS support:</strong> One of the major selling points of pkgsrc is
that it is cross-platform: it runs under multiple variants of BSD,
Linux, OS X, and other obscure systems. It is true that RPM also
works on all these systems, but Fedora&rsquo;s packaging system (auxiliary
build tools, policies, etc.) does not. There is not much more to say
about this given that this is an obvious design choice of the
developers.</p></li></ul><p>To conclude: please keep in mind that the above is not intended to
describe Fedora&rsquo;s system as a better packaging system than pkgsrc. There
are some good and bad things in each, and what you use will depend on
your use case or operating system. What motivated me to write this post
were just a few small things like Koji, Bodhi and subpackages, but I
ended up writing much more to provide context and a more detailed
comparison with pkgsrc. Now draw your own conclusions! ;-)</p></article></div></div><div class="container post-links"><div class=row><div class="col mr-auto text-left"><span><a href=https://jmmv.dev/2012/02/kyua-weekly-status-report_207.html>&#171; Previous</a></span></div><div class="col text-center"><span><a href=/archive.html>All posts</a></span></div><div class="col ml-auto text-right"><span><a href=https://jmmv.dev/2012/02/switching-projects-to-git.html>Next &#187;</a></span></div></div></div><div class="container post-votes"><div class=row><div class="col-lg-4 my-2"><div class=row><div class=col><a onclick=voteThumbsUp() class="btn btn-block btn-outline-success" id=thumbs-up-btn>👍
