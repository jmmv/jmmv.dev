        A cool photo I found today:I think I can say: don't be scared! That seems to be a power adapter so, supposedly, all those plugs are switched off when one of them is connected.  If they weren't... this would not pass any quality assurance control...   So, it is a pretty nice product :-)See the original post for more details.Edit (23rd July): Corrected the (invented) title.

        ATF is a program, and as happens with any application, it must be (automatically) tested to ensure it works according to its specifications.  But as you already know, ATF is a testing framework so... is it possible to automatically test it? Can it test itself?  Should it do it?  The thing is: it can and it should, but things are not so simple.ATF can test itself because it is possible to define test programs through ATF to check the ATF tools and libraries.  ATF should test itself because the resulting test suite will be a great source of example code and because its execution will be on its own a good stress test for the framework.  See the tests/atf directory to check what I mean; specially, the unit tests for the fs module, which I've just committed, are quite nice :-)  (For the record: there currently are 14 test programs in that directory, which account for a total of 60 test cases.)However, ATF should not be tested exclusively by means of itself.  If it did so, any failure (even the most trivial one) in the ATF's code could result in false positives or false negatives during the execution of the test suite, leading to wrong results hard to discover and diagnose.  Imagine, for example, that a subtle bug made the reporting of test failures to appear as test passes.  All tests could start to succeed immediately and nobody could easily notice, surely leading to errors in further modifications.This is why a bootstrapping test suite is required: one that ensures that the most basic functionality of ATF works as expected, but which does not use ATF to run itself.  This additional test suite is already present in the source tree, and is written using GNU Autotest, given that I'm using the GNU Autotools as the build system.  Check the tests/bootstrap directory to see what all this is about.ATF's self-testing is, probably, the hardest thing I've encountered in this project so far.  It is quite tricky and complex to get right, but it's cool!  Despite being hard, having a complete test suite for ATF is a must so it cannot be left aside.  Would you trust a testing framework if you could not quickly check that it worked as advertised?  I couldn't ;-)

        If you inspect the ATF's source code history, you'll see a lot of merges.  But why is that, if I'm the only developer working in the project?  Shouldn't the revision history be linear?Well, the thing is it needn't and it shouldn't; the subtle difference is important here :-)  It needn't be linear because Monotone is a VCS that stores history in a DAG, so it is completely natural to have a non-linear history.  In fact, distributed development requires such a model if you want to preserve the original history (instead of stacking changes on top of revisions different than the original ones).On the other hand, it shouldn't be linear because there are better ways to organize the history.  As the DaggyFixes page in the Monotone Wiki mentions:All software has bugs, and not all changes that you commit to a source tree are entirely good. Therefore, some commits can be considered "development" (new features), and others can be considered "bugfixes" (redoing or sometimes undoing previous changes). It can often be advantageous to separate the two: it is common practice to try and avoid mixing new code and bugfixes together in the same commit, often as a matter of project policy. This is because the fix can be important on its own, such as for applying critical bugfixes to stable releases without carrying along other unrelated changes.The key idea here is that you should group bug fixes alongside the original change that introduced them, if it is clear which commit is that and you can easily locate it.  And if you do that, you end up with a non-linear history that requires a merge per each bug-fix to resolve the divergences inside a single branch.I certainly recommend you to read the DaggyFixes page.  One more reason to do the switch to Monotone (or any other DAG-based VCS system, of course)? ;-)  Oh, I now notice I once blogged about this same idea, but that page is far more clear than my explanation.That is why you'll notice lots of merges in the ATF source tree: I've started applying this methodology to see how well it behaves and I find it very interesting so far.  I'd now hate switching to CVS and losing all the history for the project (because attempting to convert it to CVS's model could be painful), even if it is that not interesting.

        Wow, it has already been three years since a friend an I found a couple of old Macintoshes in a trash container1.  Each of us picked one, and maybe a year ago or so I gave mine to him as I had no space at home to keep it.  Given that he did not use them and that I enjoy playing with old hardware, I exchanged those two machines by an old Pentium 3 I had laying around :-)  The plan is to install NetBSD-current on at least one of them and some other system (or NetBSD version) in the other one to let me ensure ATF is really portable to bizarre hardware (running sane systems, though).The machines are these:A Performa 475: Motorola 68040 LC, 4MB of RAM, 250MB SCSI hard disk, no CD-ROM, Ethernet card.A Performa 630: Motorola 68040 LC, 40MB of RAM, 500-something IDE hard disk (will replace it with something bigger), CD-ROM, Ethernet card.I originally kept the Performa 630 and already played with it when we found the machines.  Among other things, I replaced the PRAM battery with a home-grown solution, added support to change the NetBSD's console colors (because the black on white default on NetBSD/mac68k is annoying to say the least) and imported the softfloat support for this platform.Then, the turn for Performa 475 came past week.  When I tried to boot it, it failed miserably.  I could hear the typical Mac's boot-time chime, but after that the screen was black and the machine was completely unresponsive.  After Googling a bit, I found that the black screen could be caused by the dead PRAM battery, but I assumed that the machine could still work; the thing is I could not hear the hard disk at all, and therefore was reluctant to put a new battery in it.  Anyway, I finally bought the battery (very expensive, around 7€!), put it in and the machine booted!Once it was up, I noticed that there was a huge amount of software installed: Microsoft Office, LaTeX tools, Internet utilities (including Netscape Navigator), etc.  And then, when checking what hardware was on the machine I was really, really surprised.  All these programs were working with only 250MB of hard disk space and 4MB of RAM!  Software bloat nowadays?  Maybe...Well, if I want this second machine to be usable, I'll have to find some more RAM for it.  But afterwards I hope it'll be able to run another version of NetBSD or maybe a Linux system.1 That also reminds me that this blog is three years old too!

        While waiting for a NetBSD release build to finish, I've prepared the web site for ATF.  It currently lacks information in a lot of areas, but the most important ones for now &mdash; the RSS feed for news and the Repository page &mdash; are quite complete.Hope you like it! Comments welcome, of course :-)

        I've finally got at a point where I can start converting some of the current regression tests in the NetBSD tree to use the new ATF system.  To prove this point, I've migrated all the tests that currently live in regress/bin to the new framework.  They all now live in /usr/tests/util/.  This has not been a trivial task &mdash; and it is not completely done yet, as there still are some rough edges &mdash; but I'm quite happy with the results.  They show me that I'm on the right track :-) and, more importantly, they show outsiders how things are supposed to work.If you want more information on this specific change you can look at the revision that implements it or simply inspect the corresponding patch file.  By the way, some of the tests already fail!  That's because they were not run often enough in the past, something that ATF is supposed to resolve.While waiting for a NetBSD release build to complete, I have started working on a real web site for ATF.  Don't know if I'll keep working on it now because it's a tough job and there is still a lot of coding to do.  Really!  But, on the other hand, having a nice project page is very good marketing.

        This year, Google sent all the Summer of Code students the Producing Open Source Software: How to run a successful free software project book by Karl Fogel (ISBN 0-596-00759-0) as a welcome present.I've just finished reading it and I can say that it was a very nice read.  The book is very easy to follow and is very complete: it covers areas such as the project's start-up, how to set things up for promoting it, how to behave in mailing lists, how to prepare releases, how to deal with volunteers or with paid developers, etc.  Everything you need to drive your project correctly and without gaining much enemies.While many of the things stated in the book are obvious to anyone who has been in the open source world for a while (and already started a project on its own or contributed to an existing one), it is still a worthy read.  I wish all the people involved in NetBSD (some more than others) read it and applied the suggestions given there.  We'd certainly improve in many key areas and reduce pointless (or better said, unpleasant) discussions!Oh, and by the way: you can read the book online at its web page, as it is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.  Kudos to Karl Fogel.
