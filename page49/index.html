        Reposting from the original ATF news entry:I have just uploaded some NetBSD-current release builds with ATF merged in.  These will ease testing to the casual user who is interested in this project because he will not need to mess with patches to the NetBSD source tree nor rebuild a full release, which is a delicate and slow process.  For the best experience, these releases are meant to be installed from scratch even though you can also do an upgrade of a current installation.  They will give you a preview of how a NetBSD installation will look like once ATF 0.1 is made public, which should happen later this month.For more details see my post to the NetBSD's current-users mailing list.Waiting for your feedback :-)Edit (Aug 20th): Fixed a link.

        Mac OS X has supported for a very long time putting Macs to sleep.  This is a must-have feature for laptops, but is also convenient for desktop machines.  However, it hasn't been since the transition to Intel-based Macs that it also supports hibernation, also called deep sleep.  When entering the hibernation mode, the system stores all memory contents to disk as well as the status of the devices.  It then powers off the machine completely.  Later on, the on-disk copy is used to restore the machine to its previous state when it is powered on.  It takes longer than resuming from sleep status, but all your applications will be there as you left them.Now, every time you put your Intel Mac to sleep it is also preparing itself to hibernate.  This is why Intel Macs take longer than PowerPC-based ones to enter the sleep mode.  This way, if the machine's battery drains completely in the case of notebooks, or the machine is unplugged in the case of desktops, the machine will be able to quickly recover itself to a safe state and you won't lose data.As I mentioned yesterday, I've been running my MacBook Pro for a while without the battery, so I had an easy chance to experiment hibernation.  And it's marvelous.  No flaws so far.The thing is that I always powered down my Mac at night.  The reason is that putting it to sleep during the whole night consumed few but enough battery to require a recharge next morning to bring it back to 100%, so I didn't do it.  But now I usually put it to hibernate; this way, on the next boot, I can continue work straight from where I left it and I don't have to restart any applications.Now... putting a Mac notebook into this mode is painful if you have to remove the battery every time to force it to enter hibernation mode, and unfortunately Mac OS X does not have any "Hibernate" option.  But... there is this sweet DashBoard widget called Deep Sleep that lets you do exactly that!  No more boots from cold state any more :-)

        It has already been a week since the last SoC-related post, so I owe you an status report.Development has continued at a constant rate and, despite I work a lot on the project, it may seem to advance slowly from an external point of view.  The thing is that getting the ATF core components complete and right is a tough job!  Just look at the current and incomplete TODO list to see what I mean.Some things worth to note:The NetBSD cross-build tool-chain no longer requires a C++ compiler to build the atf-compile host tool.  I wrote a simplified version in POSIX shell to be used as the host tool alone (not to be installed).  This is also used by the ATF's distfile to allow "cross-building" its own test programs.Improved the cleanup procedure of the test case's work directories by handling mount points in them.  This is done through a new tool called atf-cleanup.Added a property to allow test cases specify if they require root privileges or not.Many bug fixes, cleanups and new test cases; these are driving development right now.On the NetBSD front, there have also been several cosmetic improvements and bug fixes, but most importantly I've converted the tmpfs' test suite to ATF.  This conversion is what has spotted many bugs and missing features in ATF's code.  The TODO file has grown basically due to this.So, at the moment, both the regress/bin and regress/sys/fs/tmpfs trees in NetBSD have been converted to ATF.  I think that's enough for now and that I should focus on adding the necessary features to ATF to improve these tests.  One of these is to add support for a configuration file to let the user specify how certain tests should behave; e.g. how to become root or which specific file system to use for certain tests.I also have a partial implementation to add a "fork" property to test cases to execute them in subprocesses.  This way they will be able to mess all they want with the open file descriptors without disturbing the main test program.  But to get here, I first need to clean up the reporting of test case's results.On the other hand, I also started preparing manual pages for the user tools as some of them should remain fairly stable at this point.

        Back in July 7th, I disassembled my MacBook Pro to see if I could easily replace its hard disk for a faster one.  I hadn't bought it yet because I first wanted to check that the whole process was easy.  The thing is that, after a couple of problems, I could disassemble it.  So I then ran to the local store to buy the new drive.  But oh!  They didn't have it.  I decided to not reassemble the computer as one of the disassembling steps was quite scary and I didn't want to repeat it unless really necessary.Stupid me.  It has already been three weeks and they have not yet received any unit; I hate them at this point.  And yes, I've been all this time with the laptop partly disassembled, working with external peripherals and without the battery.  Which is very annoying because, even though I didn't think I really needed mobility, it is important once you get used to it.Anyway.  I have been using the machine as usual all these three weeks, and have kept working on my SoC project intensively.  Lately, I noticed that my builds were running slower than as I remembered: for example, I went away for two hours and when I came back a full NetBSD/i386 release build had not finished yet.  That was strange, but I blamed the software: things keep growing continuously, and a change in, e.g., GCC, could easily slow down everything.But yesterday, based on this thread, I installed CoreDuoTemp because I wanted to see how the processor's frequency throttling behaved.  I panicked.  The frequency meter was constantly at 1GHz (and the laptop carries a 2.16GHz processor) no matter what I did.  Thinking that it'd be CoreDuoTemp's fault, I rebooted into Windows and installed CPU-Z.  Same results.  For a moment I was worried that the machine could be faulty or that I had broken it in the disassembly process.  Fortunately, I later remembered another post that mentioned that MacBook Pros without a battery installed will run with the processor at the minimum speed; seems to be a firmware bug.Effectively: I reassembled the machine today &mdash; with the old, painful, slow, stupid, ugly, etc. disk! &mdash;, installed the battery and all is fine again.Why I am mentioning all this, though?  Well, the thing is... if it wasn't for the software rebuilds, I wouldn't have noticed any slowdown in typical desktop usage tasks such as browsing the web, reading the email, chatting, editing photos or watching videos.  And the processor was running at half of its full power!  In other words, it confirms me that extra MHz are worthless for most people.  It is "annoying" to see companies throwing away lots of perfectly-capable desktop machines, replacing them with more powerful ones that won't be used to its full capacity.  (OK, there are other reasons for the switch aside the machine's speed.)Just some numbers.  Building ATF inside a Parallels NetBSD/i386 virtual machine took "real 4m42.004s, user 1m20.466s, sys 3m16.839s" without the battery, and with it: "real 2m9.984s, user 0m22.725s, sys 1m39.053s".  Here, the speed is noticeable :-)I will blog again when I have the replacement disk and possibly post some pictures of the whole procedure.

        Back in February, I bought a copy of Parallels Desktop 2 and have been a very happy user of it since then. However, when Parallels 3 appeared, I hesitated to pre-order it (even at a very low price) and I did well: after it was released, I tried it on my MacBook Pro and their 3D support is useless for me.  I could not play neither Half-Life 2 nor Doom 3 at acceptable speeds, being the former much worse than the latter in this regard.Now, I'm evaluating VMware Fusion RC1, and I'm almost convinced to pre-order it.  This product is very similar to Parallels and in fact several of its features seem "inspired" on it, such as Unity (Coherence in Parallels speak).  But it has some important features that Parallels cannot currently match.  To know: support for 64-bit guests, support for 2 virtual CPUs in guests and support to network-boot the virtual machine.  All of these are cool from a development point of view.  The first two allow one to run some more versions of specific operating systems, such as NetBSD/amd64, as well as enabling SMP support in them.  The last one makes it easy to boot development kernels without modifying any virtual disk (haven't tried this yet, though).All is not good though.  Fusion is also supposed to have experimental 3D support inside the guest machines (up to DirectX 8.1).  However, when trying to launch Half-Life 2 inside a Windows XP SP2 virtual machine, Windows crashed with a BSOD.  At least I could launch it in Parallels, albeit it was simply unplayable.  But as none of the two products make for a good gaming experience, I personally don't care about this feature.Let's conclude with some numbers about the speed of each product.  I installed Debian GNU/Linux leeny under Parallels and Fusion and built monotone-0.35 from scratch under them.  The virtual machines were configured to have 768MB of RAM of a total of 2GB and the machine was idle aside from the build jobs.  Obviously, in the case of Parallels I could only run the test with the i386 port, but in Fusion I used both the i386 and amd64 ports with 1 and 2 virtual CPUs.  I also ran the same tests on the native machine using Mac OS X 10.4.10.  The timings only include the make command, not ./configure.Parallels, 32-bit, 1 virtual CPU, 'make':real 17m33.048s, user 14m24.342s, sys  3m4.080sFusion, 32-bit, 1 virtual CPU, 'make':real 16m35.507s, user 14m57.016s, sys  1m29.134sFusion, 32-bit, 2 virtual CPUs, 'make -j2':real 10m0.341s, user 17m23.541s, sys  2m12.604sFusion, 64-bit, 2 virtual CPUs, 'make -j2':real 10m24.617s, user 18m26.985s, sys  1m26.133sNative, Mac OS X, 'make':real 12m50.640s, user 11m12.997s, sys  1m20.344sNative, Mac OS X, 'make -j2':real 7m3.536s, user 11m22.875s, sys  1m26.366sSee this thread for other opinions.

        A cool photo I found today:I think I can say: don't be scared! That seems to be a power adapter so, supposedly, all those plugs are switched off when one of them is connected.  If they weren't... this would not pass any quality assurance control...   So, it is a pretty nice product :-)See the original post for more details.Edit (23rd July): Corrected the (invented) title.

        ATF is a program, and as happens with any application, it must be (automatically) tested to ensure it works according to its specifications.  But as you already know, ATF is a testing framework so... is it possible to automatically test it? Can it test itself?  Should it do it?  The thing is: it can and it should, but things are not so simple.ATF can test itself because it is possible to define test programs through ATF to check the ATF tools and libraries.  ATF should test itself because the resulting test suite will be a great source of example code and because its execution will be on its own a good stress test for the framework.  See the tests/atf directory to check what I mean; specially, the unit tests for the fs module, which I've just committed, are quite nice :-)  (For the record: there currently are 14 test programs in that directory, which account for a total of 60 test cases.)However, ATF should not be tested exclusively by means of itself.  If it did so, any failure (even the most trivial one) in the ATF's code could result in false positives or false negatives during the execution of the test suite, leading to wrong results hard to discover and diagnose.  Imagine, for example, that a subtle bug made the reporting of test failures to appear as test passes.  All tests could start to succeed immediately and nobody could easily notice, surely leading to errors in further modifications.This is why a bootstrapping test suite is required: one that ensures that the most basic functionality of ATF works as expected, but which does not use ATF to run itself.  This additional test suite is already present in the source tree, and is written using GNU Autotest, given that I'm using the GNU Autotools as the build system.  Check the tests/bootstrap directory to see what all this is about.ATF's self-testing is, probably, the hardest thing I've encountered in this project so far.  It is quite tricky and complex to get right, but it's cool!  Despite being hard, having a complete test suite for ATF is a must so it cannot be left aside.  Would you trust a testing framework if you could not quickly check that it worked as advertised?  I couldn't ;-)
