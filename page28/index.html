      <p>
        For a long time, I have been aware of the existence of the standard C functions setjmp and longjmp and that they can be used to simulate exceptions in C code. However, it wasn't until yesterday that I had to use them... and it was not trivial. The documentation for these functions tends to be confusing, and understanding them required looking for additional documents and a bit of experimentation. Let's see if this post helps in clarifying how these functions work.The first call to setjmp causes the process state (stack, CPU registers, etc.) to be saved in the provided jmp_buf structure and, then, a value of 0 to be returned. A subsequent call to longjmp with the same jmp_buf structure causes the process to go "back in time" to the state stored in said structure. The way this is useful is that, when going back in time, we tweak the return value of the setjmp call so we can actually run a second (or third or more) path as if nothing had happened.Let's see an example:#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;static jmp_buf buf;static voidmyfunc(void){   printf("In the function.n");   ... do some complex stuff ...   /* Go back in time: restore the execution context of setjmp    * but make the call return 1 instead of 0. */   longjmp(buf, 1);   printf("Not reached.n");}intmain(void) {   if (setjmp(buf) == 0) {       /* Try block. */       printf("Trying some function that may throw.n");       myfunc();       printf("Not reached.n");   } else {       /* Catch block. */       printf("Exception caught.n");   }   return EXIT_SUCCESS;}The example above shows the following when executed:Trying some function that may throw.In the function.Exception caught.So, what happened above? The code starts by calling setjmp to record the execution state and the call returns 0, which causes the first part of the conditional to run. You can think of this clause as the "try" part of an exception-based code. At some point during the execution of myfunc, an error is detected and is "thrown" by a call to longjmp and a value of 1. This causes the process to go back to the execution of setjmp but this time the call returns 1, which causes the second part of the conditional to run. You can think of this second clause as the "catch" part of an exception-based code.It is still unclear to me what the "execution context" stored in jmp_buf is: the documentation does not explain what kind of resources are correctly unwinded when the call to longjmp is made... which makes me wary of using this technique for exception-like handling purposes. Oh, and this is even less clear in the context of C++ code and, e.g. calls to destructors. Would be nice to expand the description of these APIs in the manual pages.

I have been lately posting more frequently than has been usual and it has been a pleasant task. I would like to recover the habit of blogging several times per week and, for that, I need topics! Keep'em coming! I already have some topics on the queue but they need a bit of research on my side first.Second, to bring Kyua to reality (i.e. to deprecate ATF). Work is continuing intensively and a preliminary release should be ready during Q1. This release will bring the much-needed replacement for atf-run.And third... well, haven't thought that much about resolutions ;-) We will see.

      <p>
        For the last couple of days, I have been playing around with the Lua C API and have been writing a thin wrapper library for C++. The main purpose of this auxiliary library is to ensure that global interpreter resources such as the global state or the execution stack are kept consistent in the presence of exceptions &mdash; and, in particular, that none of these are leaked due to programming mistakes when handling error codes.To illustrate this point, let's forget about Lua and consider a simpler case. Suppose we lost the ability to pass arguments and return values from functions in C++ and all we have is a stack that we pass around. With this in mind, we could implement a multiply function as follows:void multiply(std::stack& context) {    const int arg1 = context.top();    context.pop();    const int arg2 = context.top();    context.pop();    context.push(arg1 * arg2);}And we could call our function as this:std::stack context;context.push(5);context.push(6);multiply(context);const int result = s.top();s.pop();In fact, my friends, this is more-or-less what your C/C++ compiler is internally doing when converting code to assembly language. The way the stack is organized to perform calls is known as the calling conventions of an ABI (language/platform combination).Anyway, back to our point. One important property of such a stack-based system is that any function that deals with the stack must leave it in a consistent state: if the function pushes temporary values (read: local variables) into the stack, such temporary values must be gone upon return no matter how the function terminates. Otherwise, the caller will not find the stack as it expects, which will surely cause trouble at a later stage. The above example works just fine because our function is extremely simple and does not put anything on the stack.But things get messier when our functions can fail halfway through, and, in particular, if such failures are signaled by exceptions. In these cases, the function will abort abruptly and the function must take care to clean up any values that may still be left on the stack. Let's consider another example:void magic(std::stack& context) {    const int arg1 = context.top();    context.pop();    const int arg2 = context.top();    context.pop();    context.push(arg1 * arg2);    context.push(arg1 / arg2);    try {        ... do something with the two values on top ...        context.push(arg1 - arg2);        try {            ... do something with the three values on top ...        } catch (...) {            context.pop();  // arg1 - arg2            throw;        }        context.pop();    } catch (...) {        context.pop();  // arg1 / arg2        context.pop();  // arg1 * arg2        throw;    }    context.pop();    context.pop();}The above is a completely fictitious and useless function, but serves to illustrate the point.  magic() starts by pushing two values on the stack and then performs some computation that reads these two values.  It later pushes an additional value and does some more computations on the three temporary values that are on the top of the stack.The "problem" is that the computation code can throw an exception. If it does, we must sanitize the stack to remove the two or three values we have already pushed. Otherwise, the caller will receive the exception, it will assume nothing has happened, and will leak values on the stack (bad thing). To prevent this, we have added a couple of try/catch clauses to capture these possible exceptions and to clean up the already-pushed values before exiting the function. Unfortunately, this gets old very quickly: having to add try/catch statements surrounding every call is boring, ugly, and hard to read (remember that, potentially, any statement can throw an exception).  You can see this in the example above with the two nested try/catch blocks.To mitigate this situation, we can apply a RAII-like technique to make popping elements on errors completely transparent and automated. If we can make it transparent, writing the code is easier and reading it is trivial; if we can make it automated, we can be certain that our error paths (rarely tested!) correctly clean up any global state. In C++, destructors are deterministically executed whenever a variable goes out of scope, so we can use this to our advantage to clean up temporary values. Let's consider this class:class temp_stack {    std::stack& _stack;    int _pop_count;public:    temp_stack(std::stack& stack_) :        _stack(stack_), _pop_count(0) {}    ~temp_stack(void)    {        while (_pop_count-- > 0)            _stack.pop();    }    void push(int i)    {        _stack.push(i);        _pop_count++;    }};With this, we can rewrite our function as:void magic(std::stack& context) {    const int arg1 = context.top();    context.pop();    const int arg2 = context.top();    context.pop();    temp_stack temp(context);    temp_stack.push(arg1 * arg2);    temp_stack.push(arg1 / arg2);    ... do something with the two values on top ...    temp_stack.push(arg1 - arg2);    ... do something with the three values on top ...    // Yes, we can return now.  No need to do manual pop()s!}Simple, huh?  Our temp_stack function keeps track of how many elements have been pushed on the stack.  Whenever the function terminates, be it due to reaching the end of the body or due to an exception thrown anywhere, the temp_stack destructor will remove all elements previously registered from the stack.  This ensures that the function leaves the global state (the stack) as it was on entry &mdash; modulo the function parameters consumed as part of the calling conventions.So how does all this play together with Lua? Well, Lua maintains a stack to communicate parameters and return values between C and Lua. Such stack can be managed in a similar way with a RAII class, which makes it very easy to write native functions that deal with the stack and clean it up correctly in all cases.  I would like to show you some non-fictitious code right now, but it's not ready yet ;-)  But when it is, it will be part of Kyua.  Stay tuned!And, to conclude: to make C++ code robust, wrap objects that need manual clean up (pointers, file descriptors, etc.) with small wrapper classes that perform such clean up on destruction. These classes are typically fully inlined and contain a single member field, so they do not impose any performance penalty. But, on the contrary, your code can avoid the need of many try/catch blocks, which are tricky to get right and hard to validate.  (Unfortunately, this technique cannot be applied in, e.g. Java or Python, because the execution of the class destructors is completely non-deterministic and not guaranteed to happen whatsoever!)

      <p>
        Following my previous post on dependency injection (DI for short), I wanted to show you today another example of code in which DI helps in making the code clearer and easier to validate. In this case, the person to blame for the original piece of code being criticized is me.The atffile module in ATF provides a class to represent the contents of Atffiles. An Atffile is, basically, a file containing a list of test programs to run and a list of properties associated to these test programs. Let's consider the original implementation of this module:class atffile {    strings_vector _test_programs;    strings_vector _properties;public:    atffile(const path& file)    {        std::ifstream input(file.c_str());        _test_programs = ... parse list from input ...;        _properties = ... parse list from input ...;    }    ... getters and other read-only methods ...};According to the object-oriented programming (OOP) principles we are taught over and over again, this seems like a reasonable design. An atffile object is entirely self-contained: if the constructor finishes successfully, we know that the new object matches exactly the representation of an Atffile on disk. The other methods in the class provide read-only access to the internal attributes, which ensures that the in-memory representation remains consistent.However, this design couples the initialization of an object with external dependencies, and that is bad for two main reasons: first, because it makes testing (very) difficult; and, second, because it makes an apparently simple action (constructing an object) a potentially expensive task (reading from an external resource).To illustrate the first point, let's consider a helper free-function that deals with an atffile object:std::stringget_property(const atffile& file, const std::string& name,             const std::string& defvalue){    const strings_vector& props = file.properties();    const strings_vector::const_iterator iter =        props.find(name);    if (iter == props.end())        return defvalue;    else        return *iter;}Now, how do we write unit-tests for this function? Note that, to execute this function, we need to pass in an atffile object. And to instantiate an atffile, we need to be able to read a Atffile from disk because the only constructor for the atffile class has this dependency on an external subsystem. So, summarizing, to test this innocent function, we need to create a file on disk with valid contents, we need to instantiate an atffile object pointing to this file, and only then we can pass it to the get_property function. At this point, our unit test smells like an integration test, and it actually is for no real reason. This will cause our test suite to be more fragile (the test for this auxiliary function depends on the parsing of a file) and slow.How can we improve the situation? Easy: decoupling the dependencies on external systems from the object initialization. Take a look at this rewritten atffile class:class atffile {    strings_vector _test_programs;    strings_vector _properties;public:    atffile(const strings_vector& test_programs_,            const strings_vector& properties_) :        _test_programs(test_programs_),        _properties(properties_)    {        assert(!_test_programs.empty());    }    static atffile    parse(const path& file)    {        std::ifstream input(file.c_str());        strings_vector test_programs_ =            ... parse list from input ...;        strings_vector properties_ =            ... parse list from input ...;        return atffile(test_programs_, properties_);    }    ... getters and other read-only methods ...};Note that this new design does not necessarily violate OOP principles: yes, we can now construct an object with fake values in it by passing them to the constructor, but that does not mean that such values can be inconsistent once the object is created. In this particular example, I have added an assertion in the constructor to reenforce a check performed by parse (that an atffile must list at least one test program).With this new design in mind, it is now trivial to test the get_property function shown above: constructing an auxiliary atffile object is easy, because we can inject values into the object to later pass it to get_property: no need to create a temporary file that has to be valid and later parsed by the atffile code. Our test now follows the true sense of a unit test, which is much faster, less fragile and "to-the-point". We can later write integration tests if we so desire. Additionally, we can also write tests for atffile member functions, and we can very easily reproduce corner cases for them by, for example, injecting bad data. The only place where we need to create temporary Atffiles is when we need to test the parse class method.So, to conclude: make your class constructors as simple as possible and, in particular, do not make your class constructors depend on external systems. If you find yourself opening resources or constructing other objects from within your constructor, you are doing it wrong (with very few exceptions).I have been using the above principle for the last ~2 years and the results are neat: I am much, much more confident on my code because I write lots of more accurate test cases and I can focalize dependencies on external resources on a small subset of functions. (Yes, Kyua uses this design pattern intensively!)

      <p>
        A coworker just sent me some Python code for review and, among such code, there was the addition of a function similar to:def PathWithCurrentDate(prefix, now=None):    """Extend a path with a year/month/day subdirectory layout.    Args:        prefix: string, The path to extend with the date subcomponents.        now: datetime.date, The date to use for the path; if None, use            the current date.    Returns:        string, The new computed path with the date appended.    """    path = os.path.join(prefix, '%Y', '%m', '%d')    if now:        return now.strftime(path)    else:        return datetime.datetime.now().strftime(path)The purpose of this function, as the docstring says, is to simplify the construction of a path that lays out files on disk depending on a given date.This function works just fine... but it has a serious design problem (in my opinion) that you only see when you try to write unit tests for such function (guess what, the code to review did not include any unit tests for this). If I ask you to write tests for PathWithCurrentDate, how would you do that? You would need to consider these cases (at the very very least):Passing now=None correctly fetches the current date. To write such a test, we must stub out the call to datetime.datetime.now() so that our test is deterministic. This is easy to do with helper libraries but does not count as trivial to me.Could datetime.datetime.now() raise an exception? If so, test that the exception is correctly propagated to match the function contract.Passing an actual date to now works. We know this is a different code path that does not call datetime.datetime.now(), but still we must stub it out to ensure that the test is not going through that past in case the current date actually matches the date hardcoded in the test as an argument to now.My point is: why is such a trivial function so complex to validate? Why such a trivial function needs to depend on external state? Things become more obvious if we take a look at a caller of this function:def BackupTree(source, destination):    path = PathWithCurrentDate(destination)    CreateArchive(source, os.path.join(path, 'archive.tar.gz'))Now, question again: how do we test this? Our tests would look like:def testOk(self):    # Why do we even have to do this?    ... create stub for datetime.datetime.now() to return a fake date ...   CreateArchive('/foo', '/backups/prefix')   ... validate that the archive was generated in the fake date directory ...Having to stub out the call to datetime.datetime.now() before calling CreateArchive is a really, really weird thing at first glance. To be able to write this test, you must have deep insight of how the auxiliary functions called within the function work to know what dependencies on external state they have. Lots of black magic involved.All this said, the above may not seem like a big issue because, well, a call to datetime.datetime.now() is cheap. But imagine that the call being performed deep inside the dependency tree was more expensive and dealt with some external state that is hard to mock out.The trick to make this simpler and clearer is to apply a form of Dependency injection (or, rather, "value injection"). We want the PathWithCurrentDate function to be a simple data manipulation routine that has no dependencies on external state (i.e. make it purely functional). The easiest way to do so is to remove the now=None code path and pass the date in right from the most external caller (aka, the main() program).  For example (skipping docstrings for brevity):def PathWithCurrentDate(prefix, now):    path = os.path.join(prefix, '%Y', '%m', '%d')    return now.strftime(path)def BackupTree(source, destination, backup_date):    path = PathWithCurrentDate(destination, backup_date)    CreateArchive(source, os.path.join(path, 'archive.tar.gz'))With this approach, the dependency on datetime.datetime.now() (aka, a dependency on global state) completely vanishes from the code. The code paths to validate are less, and they are much simpler to test. There is no need to stub out a function call seemingly unused by BackupTree.Another advantage of this approach can be seen if we were to have multiple functions accessing the same path. In this case, we would need to ensure that all calls receive the exact same date... what if the program kept running past 12AM and the "now" value changed? It is trivial to reason about this feature if the code does not have hidden queries to "now" (aka global state) within the code... but it becomes tricky to ensure our code is right if we can't easily audit where the "now" value is queried from!The "drawback", as some will think, is that the caller of any of these functions must do more work on its own to provide the correct arguments to the called functions.  "And if I always want the backup to be created on the current directory, why can't the backup function decide on itself?", they may argue.  But, to me, the former is definitely not a drawback and the latter... is troublesome as explained in this post.Another "drawback", as some others would say, is that testing is not a goal. Indeed it is not: testing is only a means to "correct" code, but it is also true that having testable code often improves (internal) APIs and overall design.To conclude: the above is an over-simplistic case study and my explanations will surely not convince anyone to stop doing black evil "clever" magic from within functions (and, worse, from within constructors).  You will only realize that the above makes any sense when you start unit-testing your code. Start today! :-)

        Over a week ago, I mostly finished the implementation of the runtime engine for test cases of Kyua and, along the way, realized that it is imperative to write a configuration system right now before the configuration code becomes messier than it already is.To that end, I spent the last week working on a design document for the configuration system. Summarizing, the document describes what the requirements for the configuration files of Kyua are, what the possible alternatives to implement them are, and advocates the use of Lua &mdash; a tiny embedded programming language &mdash; to bring these configuration files to life.It is your chance to get involved in the early stages of the development of Kyua! :-) Take a look at the email to kyua-discuss asking for comments and feel free to join the mailing list ;-)

        Did you ever wonder where the "sticky" part of the "sticky bit" name comes from? I actually didn't, but I just came across the Sticky bit page on Wikipedia through a tweet from @AaronToponce and discovered why.If you have used any "recent" (the quotes are important) Unix-like system, you probably know what the sticky bit is used for: to restrict the deletion of files in a directory to, basically, the owner of such files. The sticky bit is used on /tmp (among other directories) so that anyone can create temporary files in it but only those that created the temporary files can delete them.But that's not all that is to know.The original purpose of the sticky bit was to mark frequently-used executable files so that the operating system kept their text segment on swap space. This speeded up subsequent executions of such programs because the system would not need to access the file system to load the binary: it could just use the image already kept in the swap space. This behavior became obsolete with the advent of memory-mapped executables.Now it's clear why the sticky bit has the name it has, isn't it?  But still, that's not all that is to know.SunOS 4 introduced a new behavior for the sticky bit on regular, non-executable files: reads and writes to such files would bypass the buffer cache, thus basically telling the system to perform raw I/O on those files. This was particularly useful on swap files when NFS was involved.With the above, I have just tried to summarize you the information that is in NetBSD's chmod(2) and sticky(7) manual pages; they contain much more detailed information. (And yep, that's right: contrary to what the Wikipedia article says, NetBSD does not support this behavior any more.) Hope you found this insightful if you did not know this little piece of history!
